      "value": "<p>When you cast this power, you inscribe a glyph that affects other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a Treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this power, the glyph is broken, and the power ends without being triggered.</p><p>The glyph is nearly Invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your power save DC to be found.</p><p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the power. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most Common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this power ends.</p><p>You can further refine the trigger so the power activates only under certain circumstances or according to Physical Characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect Aberrations or drow), or Alignment. You can also set Conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p><p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a power glyph.</p><p><strong>Explosive Runes</strong>. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph. The Sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong>Power Glyph</strong>. You can store a prepared power of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The power must target a single creature or an area. The power being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored power is cast. If the power has a target, it Targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the power affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the power summons hostile creatures or creates harmful Objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and Attack it. If the power requires Concentration, it lasts until the end of its full Duration.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this power using a power slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a power glyph, you can store any power of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.</p>",
