The power has no effect but is stored within the {creature}. When commanded to do so by the wearer or when a situation arises that was predefined by the powercaster, the {creature} casts the stored power with any parameters set by the original caster, requiring no components. When the power is cast or a new power is stored, any previously stored power is lost.</p>",
