She gives the order and her allies unleash a single coordinated attack cutting deep into their lines. Under her command the enemy is quickly routed against all odds, all according to plan.</p>\n<p>Deep within the once thought abandoned ruins, a nautolan tends to his companions wounds as they rest. Countless long nights of study and training have conditioned him to keep going even when all others have exhausted themselves. He will see them through this.</p>\n<p>A twi&rsquo;lek in fine vestments addresses a gathering crowd. What was the making of an angry mob begins to disperse, his mere presence putting them at ease, giving his companions time to make their escape.</p>\n<p>Scholars are master of the mundane arts, using methodical practices to turn the tables to their advantage. From years of study and testing, scholars take in the situation around them and quickly formulate the means to achieve whatever they have minds set to. Whatever pursuit they follow, a scholar will have a plan for anything that comes their way.</p>\n<h2>The Pursuit of Knowledge</h2>\n<p>A true scholar is never satisfied. They are always seeking out a new answer to a new question. This often goes hand-in-hand with seeking a life of adventure, to explore new, hidden areas, or accompany those that do. The life of a scholar often times begins in the mundane, as a teacher or sage. Sometimes they serve as doctors, diplomats, or as officers in the military.</p>\n<h2>To Learn, To Know</h2>\n<p>For scholars, mundane life is often too slow. When life becomes stagnant or when an answer cannot be found, the call to adventure rings louder. Scholars will often go to ancient, forgotten, and often dangerous places to find something to quench their thirst for knowledge.</p>\n<p>As you create a scholar, it's important to think of where you gained your knowledge. Did you serve as an apprentice under a master? Did you attend college or other formal education? Perhaps you gained it on your own, searching out and pouring over dusty tomes found in forgotten places. Where did your thirst for knowledge come from? Insatiable curiosity? Always wanting to know the right answer? Or do you have something to prove? Think about what field you wish to pursue and think of what is driving you in that direction.</p>\n<h3>Quick Build</h3>\n<p>You can make a scholar quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score. Your next-highest score should be Dexterity. Second, choose the @Compendium[sw5e.backgrounds.aiBPuaLODR08hveu]{Noble} background.</p>",

techblades</p>\n<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Any one</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Wisdom, Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose three from Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Lore, Medicine, Nature, Persuasion, and Survival</p>\n<h3>Equipment</h3>\n<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>(a)</em> a simple vibroweapon or <em>(b)</em> a simple blaster and two power cells</li>\n<li><em>(a)</em> scholar&rsquo;s pack or <em>(b)</em> explorer&rsquo;s pack</li>\n<li>a combat suit</li>\n<li>any tool of your choice</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"mt-2\">Variant: Starting Wealth</h3>\n<p>In lieu of the equipment granted by your class and background, you can elect to purchase your starting gear. If you do so, you receive no equipment from your class and background, and instead roll for your starting wealth using the criteria below:</p>\n<table style=\"border: 0px; width: 300px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>Class</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\"><strong>Funds</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">Scholar</td>\n<td style=\"width: 150px;\">6d4 x 100 cr</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Academic Superiority</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 1st level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.</p>\n<h3>Maneuvers</h3>\n<p>You know two maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under &ldquo;Maneuvers&rdquo; below, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the scholar class table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.</p>\n<p>Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.</p>\n<h3>Superiority Dice</h3>\n<p>You have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice column of the scholar class table. This die changes as you gain scholar levels, as shown in the Academic Superiority column of the scholar class table. A superiority die is expended when you use it.</p>\n<p>You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Saving Throws</h3>\n<p>Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver&rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Maneuver save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h2>Maneuvers</h2>\n<p>The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Administer Aid</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can expend a superiority die to tend to a creature you can touch. The creature regains a number of hit points equal to the number rolled + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Assess the Situation</h3>\n<p>You can expend one superiority die to make a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check as a bonus action, adding the superiority die to the check.</p>\n<h3>Crippling Strike</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to cripple the creature. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll and the creature&rsquo;s speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of their next turn.</p>\n<h3>Deliberate Movement</h3>\n<p>You can expend one superiority die to take the Disengage action as a bonus action and ignore the effects of standard difficult terrain until the end of your turn.</p>\n<h3>Exploit Weakness</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and deal additional damage equal to the number rolled. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.</p>\n<h3>Goading Attack</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Heads Up</h3>\n<p>When a friendly creature who can see or hear you makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die, adding the number rolled to the result of the saving throw. You can use this maneuver before or after making the saving throw, but before any effects of the saving throw are determined.</p>\n<h3>Measured Action</h3>\n<p>As a reaction when you make a roll for a contested skill check, you can expend a superiority die to add to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the contested skill check roll, but before any effects of the contested skill check are determined.</p>\n<h3>One Step Ahead</h3>\n<p>When you roll initiative and you are not surprised, you can expend a superiority die and add the number rolled to your initiative.</p>\n<h3>Targeted Strike</h3>\n<p>When an ally makes an attack against a creature, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die. You add the superiority die to the attack roll, and the damage roll if it hits. You can use this maneuver before or after the attack roll, but before the GM determines whether or not the attack hits.</p>\n<h2>Critical Analysis</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you are able to analyze a target, develop a plan on how to best overcome any potential obstacle, and execute that plan with ruthless efficiency. As a bonus action on your turn, you can analyze a target you can see within 60 feet of you. For the next minute, or until you analyze another target, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you analyze a hostile creature, your attack and damage rolls made with weapons with the finesse property or blaster weapons against that target may use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity.</li>\n<li>When you analyze a friendly creature, the target can end your Critical Analysis on them (no action required) to add your Intelligence modifier to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once a friendly creature has benefited from this ability, they can not do so again until they complete a short or long rest.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Discovery</h2>\n<p>As you adventure, your studies have helped you discover new practices you can apply to your skills.</p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you master two discoveries of your choice. Your discovery options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain scholar levels, you gain additional discoveries of your choice, as shown in the Discoveries column of the scholar class table.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discovery that you could learn at that level.</p>\n<h2>Sage Advice</h2>\n<p>When you reach 2nd level, you can spend 1 minute spreading your knowledge and experience, advising those around you. When you do so, choose a skill or tool you are proficient with and a number of friendly creatures up to your Intelligence modifier within 30 feet of you who can hear you and who can understand you. Once within the next hour, the next time each creature would make an ability check with the chosen skill or tool, they may add their proficiency bonus to the roll if they are not already proficient. A creature may only benefit from this feature once. If a creature is targeted by this feature again before using it, they can choose to retain the first benefit or replace it with the new skill or tool instead.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Starting at 13th level, you regain the ability to use it after you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Expertise</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of skill proficiencies and one of your tool proficiencies, or two of your tool proficiencies. You gain expertise in those skills or tools.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, you can choose another two proficiencies (in skills or tools) to gain this benefit.</p>\n<h2>Academic Pursuit</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, you dedicate your studies towards a pursuit, which is detailed at the end of the class description. The pursuit you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 9th, and 17th level.</p>\n<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you can choose a feat (see Chapter 6 for a list of feats).</p>\n<h2>Multitasker</h2>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, you can take a second reaction each round. You can only take one reaction per turn.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when a friendly creature you can see that can hear you is forced to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to target them with your Critical Analysis feature.</p>\n<h2>Calm and Collected</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 14th level, when you make a saving throw from an effect you can see, you may gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>Once you have used this feature, you must wait until a short or long rest before using it again.</p>\n<h2>Adaptable Intellectual</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, you are able to effectively prepare for any mission on hand. At the end of a long rest, you may choose one of the discoveries you know and replace it with another discover that you could learn at that level.</p>\n<h2>Knowledge Unbound</h2>\n<p>When you reach 20th level, you are the pinnacle of your pursuit.
