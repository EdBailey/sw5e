If you could already take the Guard action as a bonus action, you can instead take it as a reaction on your turn.</li><li>When you move on your turn, you can use a bonus action to allow a willing ally within 5 feet of you to move with you (no action required by the ally). The ally must end this movement within 5 feet of you, and this movement can't exceed the ally's speed.</li><li>When you choose to let an attack that would hit a guarded ally hit you instead, the creature rolls the damage as normal instead of choosing the maximum.</li></ul>"
