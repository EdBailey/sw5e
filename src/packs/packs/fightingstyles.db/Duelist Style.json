On a success, you have advantage on the first attack roll you make against them before the start of your next turn.</li><li>When you miss with a weapon attack on your turn, you can use your bonus action to repeat the attack against the same target. Any modifications to the original attack roll, such as advantage, disadvantage, or without your proficiency bonus, also affect this attack roll.</li><li>Once on each of your turns, drawing or stowing a one-handed weapon no longer requires your object interaction.</li></ul>"
