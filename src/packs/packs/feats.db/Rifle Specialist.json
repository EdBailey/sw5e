You gain the following benefits while wielding any of these weapons, if you are proficient with it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain a +1 bonus to the weapon's attack rolls.</li>\n<li>Whenever you have advantage on an attack roll and hit, and the lower of the two d20 rolls would also hit, you can attempt to snare the target. If the target is no more than one size larger than you (your size or smaller if your weapon has the light property), it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or its movement speed is reduced by half until the end of it's next turn. If it's speed was already reduced by half, it is instead reduced to 5 feet.</li>\n<li>When a creature you can see misses you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to Disengage and move up to half your speed. You must end this movement further away from the creature than you started.</li>\n</ul>",
