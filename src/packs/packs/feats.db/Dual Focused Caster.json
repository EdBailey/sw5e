You must spend your action each subsequent round on maintaining this concentration, or lose concentration for both powers.</li>\n<li>At the end of each of your turns where you have two powers you are concentrating on, you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equals 10 + the number of complete rounds you've been concentrating on two powers). On a failure, you lose concentration for both powers. You can drop concentration on one of your powers during your turn as a free action to avoid this saving throw.</li>\n<li>Any time you would be forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration due to taking damage, the DC equals 10 + both powers' levels combined, or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. On a failure, you lose concentration on both powers.</li>\n</ul>",
