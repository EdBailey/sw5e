You gain the following benefits while wielding any of these weapons, if you are proficient with it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain a +1 bonus to the weapon's attack rolls.</li>\n<li>When a creature rolls a 1 on the saving throw against one of these weapons, it takes damage as if suffering a critical hit. If a creature would already suffer a critical hit when it rolls a 1 on this weapon's saving throw, it instead suffers a critical hit on a roll of 1 or 2.</li>\n<li>Whenever you score a critical hit against a creature that is holding an object, you can attempt to disarm the target. If the target is no more than one size larger than you (your size or smaller if your weapon has the light property), it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or it drops an object of your choice at its feet.</li>\n</ul>",
