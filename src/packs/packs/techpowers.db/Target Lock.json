If the target drops to 0 hit points before this power ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Overcharge Tech.</strong></em> When you cast this power using a tech slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the power for up to 8 hours.
