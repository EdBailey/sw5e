On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes wreathed in a sonic barrier until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves before then, it immediately takes sonic damage equal to your techcasting modifier, becomes deafened until the start of your next turn, and the power ends.</p>\n<p>This power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the ranged attack deals an extra 1d6 sonic damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 1d6 + your techcasting ability modifier.  Both damage rolls increase by an additional 1d6 at 11th and 17th level.</p>\n",
