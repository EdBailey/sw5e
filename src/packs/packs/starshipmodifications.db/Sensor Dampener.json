The target makes a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your Charisma (Interfere) bonus. On a failed save, the ship is blinded for 1 minute. As an action on each of the ship's turns, a crew member on the affected ship can repeat this save, ending the effect on a success.</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p><p>Additionally, your ship is proficiently equipped for Dexterity (Hide) checks. If your ship is already proficiently equipped, it is instead considered expertly equipped. </p>"
