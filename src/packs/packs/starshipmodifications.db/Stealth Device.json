A crew member can activate or deactivate a stealth mode as an action. While active, your ship has advantage on Dexterty (Hide) checks that rely on scanners, but your ship has disadvantage on Intelligence (Probe) and Wisdom (Scan) checks that rely on scanners.</p><p>Additionally, if you try to enter hyperspace while the cloaking device is active, you must roll on the [Hyperspace Mishaps](#Hyperspace%20Mishaps) table on page 76.</p><p>Finally, your ship is proficiently equipped for Dexterity (Hide) checks.  If your ship is already proficiently equipped, it is instead considered expertly equipped.</p>"
