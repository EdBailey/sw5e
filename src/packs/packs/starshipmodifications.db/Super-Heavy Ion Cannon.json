            "value": "<p>Your ship is equipped with a weapon designed to disable enemy ships without damaging them through use of a specialized ion cannon that delivers a powerful electromagnetic burst. A crew member can fire the super-heavy ion cannon at a target as an action, which has a range of 1,000 feet and a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + the crew member's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of the ship's turns, a crew member can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p><p>If a ship is targeted by a ship two or more sizes larger than them, it has disadvantage on the initial saving throw. If targeted by a ship two or more sizes smaller, it instead has advantage.</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>"
