The vault is equipped with both a key and a code lock, and is magnetically sealed to prevent it opening in the event of power failure. The vault can be accessed with a DC 25 Intelligence (Security Kit) check. When the vault is accessed, an alarm sounds in the Bridge and Security Suite (if it exists). If a player rolls a 30 or higher on the Intelligence (Security Kit) check to unlock the vault, or has the key or code, the alarm can be bypassed.</p>"
