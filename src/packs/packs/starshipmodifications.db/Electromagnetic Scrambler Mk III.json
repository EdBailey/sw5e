The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier). If the ship is directly piloted by a humanoid that is not incapacitated, it gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to the pilot's Intelligence modifier. On a failed save, the target loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all ships it can see as enemies until the power ends. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>Whenever the affected ship chooses another target, it must choose the target at random from among the ships it can see within range of the attack, power, or other ability it's using. </p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>"
