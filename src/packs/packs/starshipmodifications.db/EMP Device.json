            "value": "<p>This modification adds a reusable EMP device to disable nearby electronics.  As an action, a crew member can activate the device.  Each ship, within 100 feet must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + the crew member's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of the ship's turns, a crew member can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.  You ship automatically fails the initial saving throw, but has advantage on subsequent saving throws against this effect.</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>"
