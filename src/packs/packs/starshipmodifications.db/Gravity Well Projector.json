A crew member can activate or deactivate the gravity well projector as an action, which has a range of 1,000 feet and a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. While active, this ship and ships of the same size or smaller that enter or start their turn within the gravity well projector's firing arc can't activate their hyperdrives.</p>"
