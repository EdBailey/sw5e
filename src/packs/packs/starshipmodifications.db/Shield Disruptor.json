            "value": "<p>This modification adds a shield disruptor to a ship, which is used to interfere with another ship's shield. As an action, a crew member can activate the shield disruptor and choose a ship they can see within 1,000 feet. You make a Charisma (Interfere) check contested by the target's Constitution (Regulate) check. On a failed save, the ship's shield capacity and shield regeneration rate are reduced by half for 1 minute. If the ship's current shield points would exceed the new shield capacity, they are reduced accordingly. At the start of each of the target ship's turns, a crew member can use an action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p><p>If a ship is targeted by a larger ship, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. If targeted by a smaller ship, it instead has advantage.</p><p>You can end the shield disruptor at any time (no action required).</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>"
