As an action, a crew member can attempt suppress the target's communications by forcing them to succeed at a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Charisma (Interfere) bonus). On a failure, the target's communications are suppressed, preventing any communication to or from external sources. On a success, they become immune to this feature for one day.</p><p>Additionally, your ship is proficiently equipped for Charisma (Interfere) checks.  If your ship is already proficiently equipped, it is instead considered expertly equipped.</p>"
