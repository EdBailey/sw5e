Each ship within 100 feet of your ship must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + the crew members's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship's flying speed is reduced by 100 feet and its turning speed is increased by 50 feet until the end of your ship's next turn.</p><p>If a ship is two or more sizes larger than your ship, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it is two or more sizes smaller, it instead has disadvantage. </p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>"
