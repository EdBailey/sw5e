Over the course of 10 minutes, a crew member can make a constitution (Regulation) check (DC  = 10 or half the number of days since the ship's last refueling, whichever number is higher). On a success, the ship recovers one day's worth of fuel.</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes refitting.</p>"
