Each time the ship takes damage or is the target of a hostile power or ability while disabled in this way, it can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p>\n<p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>"
