For the duration, it is difficult terrain.</p><p>When the gas appears, each ship in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's constitution modifier) or become ionized. A ship that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw.</p><p>The gas is flammable. Any 50 foot square of the gas exposed to fire burns away in one round. Each ship that enters the fire or starts it turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area.</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>"
