When a forcecaster completes a long rest involving this suite, they gain temporary force points equal to their force power maximum power level + their Wisdom or Charisma modifier (their choice, minimum of one). When you would spend a force point while you have temporary force points, the temporary force points are spent first. All temporary force points are lost at the end of your next long rest.</p>"
