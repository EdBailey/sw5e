Each ship in a 50-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's wisdom modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 3d6 cold damage, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a ship takes half as much damage and isn't slowed.</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>"
