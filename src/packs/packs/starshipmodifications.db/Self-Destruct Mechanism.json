A crew member can activate the self-destruct mechanism as an action, setting a timer up to 10 minutes in length. When the timer expires, the ship explodes, dealing thermite damage to each enemy within range. The damage is calculated as follows; for each Hull Die the ship has, roll it and add the ship's Strength modifier to the roll. </p><p>The range that the self-destruct mechanism impacts varies, depending on the ship's size:</p><ul><li><strong>Tiny:</strong> A Tiny ship deals damage to each ship within 50 feet of it.</li><li><strong>Small:</strong> A Small ship deals damage to each ship within 100 feet of it.</li><li><strong>Medium:</strong> A Medium ship deals damage to each ship within 200 feet of it.</li><li><strong>Large:</strong> A Large ship deals damage to each ship within 400 feet of it.</li><li><strong>Huge:</strong> A Huge ship deals damage to each ship within 1,000 feet of it.</li><li><strong>Gargantuan:</strong> A Gargantuan ship deals damage to each ship within 2,000 feet of it.</li></ul>"
