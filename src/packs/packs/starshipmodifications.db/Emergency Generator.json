When your ship is reduced to 0 shield points but not destroyed outright, a crew member can use their reaction to have it drop to 1 shield point instead. Alternatively, if the ship has 0 shield points, a crew member can use their action to restore shield points equal to twice the ship's strength modifier. </p><p>Once either feature has been used, the power backup can't be used again until the ship recharges.</p>"
