The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's charisma modifier), or it takes 1d6 lightning damage and moves 50 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 50 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. If the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.</p><p>This power's damage increases by 1d6 for every tier your ship is above first tier: 2nd tier (2d6), 3rd tier (3d6), 4th tier (4d6), and 5th tier (5d6).</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>"
