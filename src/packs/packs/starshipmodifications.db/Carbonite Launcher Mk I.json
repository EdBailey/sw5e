On a failed save, a ship takes 2d6 cold damage and gains a level of slowed until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage, and suffers no additional effect.</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>"
