This transponder code can differ from your primary transponder code in terms of ship's owner, designation, make and model, any registered modifications, and the ship's ownership history. </p><p>A crew member can switch the ship's transponder code as an action. A creature can determine this transponder code is a fake by making an Intelligence (Technology) check (DC = 8 + your ship's bonus to Charisma (Swindle) checks). On a success, they determine that your transponder code is a fake.</p><p>Additionally, your ship is proficiently equipped for Charisma (Swindle) checks.  If your ship is already proficiently equipped, it is instead considered expertly equipped.</p>"
