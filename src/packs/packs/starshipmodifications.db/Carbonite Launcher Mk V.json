Each ship in the affected area must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's iwisdom modifier). On a failed save, the ship takes 8d6 + 20 cold damage and is stunned for 1 minute as it is encased in carbonite. On a successful save, the ship takes half damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn.</p><p>As an action, a crew member of a stunned ship can make a Strength check (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship's wisdom modifier), ending this effect on itself on a success.</p><p>A ship reduced to 0 hit points by this power explodes instantly, as its hull shatters into frozen chunks.</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>"
