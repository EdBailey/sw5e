When a techcaster completes a long rest involving this suite, as long as they have their techcasting focus, they gain temporary tech points equal to their tech power maximum power level + their Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). When you would spend a tech point while you have temporary tech points, the temporary tech points are spent first. All temporary tech points are lost at the end of your next long rest.</p>"
