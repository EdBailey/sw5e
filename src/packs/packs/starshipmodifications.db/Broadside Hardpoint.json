The hardpoints must share at least 1 limited firing arc, and the two firing arcs of a hardpoint need not be adjacent.  This modification installs a dedicated gunner station for each hardpoint.  Attacks made utilizing the additional limited firing arc can only be made by a crew member deployed at the dedicated gunner station of the weapon.</p>"
