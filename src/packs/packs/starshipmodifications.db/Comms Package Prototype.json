Crew members can now communicate in real time with any planets, space stations, and starships in the same territory as you as long as they are similarly equipped.</p><p>Additionally, when your ship sends out communications, those communications can be encrypted, only understandable by recipients with the cipher. A crew member can encrypt communications by making an Intelligence (Slicer Tools) check, setting the decrypt DC. Another crew member can spend 1 minute attempting to decode the encrypted communications by making an Intelligence check against the decrypt DC. On a success, they decrypt the message. On a failure, they do not decrypt your encrypted message, and can't attempt to do so again for one day. </p><p>Lastly, your ship is expertly equipped for Charisma (Broadcast) checks.</p>"
