These Buzz Droids tear apart the hull of any ship that encounters them. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a ship moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 kinetic damage directly to the hull for every 50 feet it travels.</p><p>The Buzz Droids are nearly invisible in the darkness of space. Any creature or ship that can't see the area at the time the area is created must make a Wisdom (Scan) check (DC 15) to notice the Buzz Droids before entering the area.</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.</p>"
