The weapon attached to the chosen fixed hardpoint now has an unlimited firing arc in addition to its limited arc, as described in chapter 9.  This hardpoint also installs a dedicated gunner station at or about the hardpoint.  Attacks made utilizing the unlimited firing arc can only be made by a crew member deployed at the dedicated gunner station of the weapon.</p>"
