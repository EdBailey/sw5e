Each ship within the firing arc must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + ship tier + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship is tractored.  As a bonus action, a player can move a tractored ship 100 feet in any direction. As an action, a pilot of a tractored ship can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p><p>The saving throws are made with advantage if the target is larger than you, and with disadvantage if smaller.</p><p>If you are attempting to tractor a ship larger than you, fail or success, you can choose to gain the tractored condition and move yourself instead.</p><p>You can end the tractor beam at any time (no action required).</p><p>This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.</p>"
