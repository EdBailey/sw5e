Make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If you have dealt damage to the creature in the last hour, it has advantage on the check. If your check succeeds, the target is charmed by you until the start of your next turn, and it has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes against a creature before the end of its next turn. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>",
