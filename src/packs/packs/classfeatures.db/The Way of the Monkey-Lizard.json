As a part of this bonus action, and as a bonus action on each of your turns, when you take the Dodge action, you can make one melee weapon attack against a creature within range. Additionally, when you make this melee weapon attack, you can flourish your weapon to attempt to distract your target. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by a Wisdom (Perception) check of the target of your attack. On a success, you make this attack roll with advantage.</p>\n<p>This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
