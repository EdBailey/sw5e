If your check succeeds, if a friendly creature makes an attack roll against the target and they can see and hear you, you can use your reaction to grant them advantage on the roll. If you do so, and they hit, they deal additional damage equal to your bonus to Investigation checks. This damage is the same type as the attack&rsquo;s damage. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>",
