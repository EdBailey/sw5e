            "value": "<p>Starting at 6th level, you learn to simultaneously limit a creature&rsquo;s force powers and store that power within yourself to later strengthen your damaging force powers.</p>\n<p>You can store a maximum number of power surges equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Whenever you successfully end a force power with a power such as&nbsp;force suppression&nbsp;or&nbsp;sever force, or use your Force Shield or Force Deflection features to successfully avoid an attack or succeed on a saving throw, you gain one power surge, as you redirect the flow of the Force into yourself.</p>\n<p>Once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature or object with a force power, you can spend one power surge to deal extra damage to that target. The extra damage is of the same type as the power&rsquo;s damage, and it equals half your consular level (rounded down).</p>\n<p>Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge.</p>",
