When a friendly creature you can see is the target of a ranged attack, or forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, and you can see the source of the effect, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards the friendly creature. You must end this move closer to the ally than you started. If you end this movement between your ally and the source of the effect, you provide cover for the attack.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you provide three-quarters cover, instead of half-cover, to creatures your size, and you provide full cover to creatures smaller than you.</p>",
