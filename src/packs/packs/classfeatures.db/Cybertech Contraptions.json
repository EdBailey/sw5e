            "value": "<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to modify gadgets and wristpads utilizing your cybertech knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify your wristpad. You must have a wristpad and cybertech&rsquo;s implements in order to perform this modification.</p>\n<p>Your wristpad requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified wristpad has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\n<p>Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.</p>\n<h2>CYBERTECH MODIFICATIONS</h2>\n<p>If a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the modification at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>ADVANCED BIOTIC AMPLIFIER</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;15th level</em><br /><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Prototype Biotic Amplifier</em><br />You further fine tune your biotic amplifier.

When you activate this amplifier, the next attack roll made against that creature before the end of its next turn has advantage.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>PROTOTYPE CRYO AMPLIFIER</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;7th level</em><br /><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Cryo Amplifier</em><br />You fine tune your Cryo Amplifier. When you activate this amplifier, the creature gains 1 slowed level until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>PROTOTYPE EXPLOSIVE AMPLIFIER</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;7th level</em><br /><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Explosive Amplifier</em><br />You fine tune your Explosive Amplifier. When you activate this amplifier, the creature is also ignited for 1 minute. At the start of each of its turns, the creature</p>\n<p>takes additional fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier and then makes a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC, ending this effect on a success. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames, the effect ends.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>POWERED GRAPPLING HOOK</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;9th level</em><br /><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook</em><br />While your wrist-mounted grappling hook is deployed, when you cast a tech power with a range of touch, your hook can deliver the power as if it had cast it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SENTRY TURRET</strong></h4>\n<p>You learn how to craft small sentry turrets shaped like globes that can adhere to any surface. As an action or bonus action (your choice), you can throw a sentry to a point you can see within range (30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5). At the end of each of your turns, a deployed sentry automatically targets a hostile creature within 10 feet of it. If multiple targets are available, one is chosen at random. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d4 energy damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p>The sentries have 1 hit point, an armor class of 10, and can be repaired over the course of a long rest. Each sentry lasts for 1 minute before deactivating. You can maintain a number of sentries equal to your Intelligence modifier. Once a sentry has been activated, it can&rsquo;t be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TRUESIGHT GOGGLES</strong></h4>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;11th level</em><br /><em><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;Darkvision Goggles</em><br />You modify your goggles with a toggle allowing you to briefly gain enhanced sight. As a bonus action, you can activate the truesight feature of your goggles. When toggled on, for the next minute your goggles now automatically dispel illusions and can detect invisibility, as with truesight.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>WRIST-MOUNTED GRAPPLING HOOK</strong></h4>\n<p>You craft a wrist-mounted grappling hook weapon attached to a tightly coiled cord. With this contraption, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d4 kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.</p>\n<p>A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the hook. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the hook. Removing the hook requires a Strength check. While the hook is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.</p>\n<p>While the hook is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is your size or larger. A creature or object smaller than you is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you recover and reinsert the hook as an action.</p>\n</blockquote>",
