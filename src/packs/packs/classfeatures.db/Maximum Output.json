            "value": "<p>Beginning at 7th level, when you take the Attack action while wielding a weapon with the heavy or strength properties, you can forgo one or more attacks. If you do so, the first time you deal damage with the weapon before the start of your next turn, you deal additional damage of the same type as the weapon&rsquo;s damage. If this instance would deal damage to multiple creatures, you can only apply this additional damage to one of them. For each attack you forgo, you deal additional damage equal to 1d12 + half your fighter level (rounded down). If you miss with the first attack roll you make before the end of your next turn, or one target succeeds on the saving throw against your weapon&rsquo;s burst or rapid property, you instead deal normal weapon damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
