If your beast is within 30 feet of you and can see or hear you, you can command it to enter a furious state. While raging, your beast gains the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your beast has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws if it is size Medium or larger.</li>\n<li>Your beast has advantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws if it is size Small or smaller.</li>\n<li>When your beast hits with an attack, it deals bonus damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.</li>\n<li>Your beast has resistance to kinetic and energy damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your beast&rsquo;s furious state lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if your beast is knocked unconscious. You can end your beast&rsquo;s furious state as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
