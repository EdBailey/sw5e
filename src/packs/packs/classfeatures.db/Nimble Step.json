When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to maneuver across the battlefield.</p>\n<p>Some of your fancy footworks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the debilitating strike&rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Nimble Step save DC</strong>&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>BLADE DEFENSE</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to determine your target&rsquo;s next strike. Roll two Sneak Attack dice, and the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your AC increases by the higher amount rolled on the dice against the first attack it makes against you before the start of your next turn. On a successful save, your AC instead increases by the lower amount.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>DISARMING STRIKE</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to disarm a creature with your attack. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced to drop one item of your choice that it&rsquo;s holding. If you have a free hand, you can catch the item. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>FANCY FOOTWORK</strong></h4>\n<p>Roll two Sneak Attack dice. Your speed increases by 5 x the greater result of the two dice, and you ignore difficult terrain until the end of your current turn.</p>\n</blockquote>",
