Each creature within 5 feet of your tracker droid must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. A creature takes 1d4 ion damage for each Hit Die expended in this way on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. Any electronics not being worn or carried within the blast radius are disabled until rebooted.</p>",
