While in darkness, you are invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack while hidden, you can force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, the creature&rsquo;s speed is reduced to 0 until the end of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
