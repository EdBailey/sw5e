Once per round, after an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check is rolled by you or a creature that you can see, you can replace the number on the d20 with a 7. Note the number on the d20 of the roll that you replaced. That number becomes your borrowed luck roll.</p>\n<p>While you have a borrowed luck roll, you can expend it and replace any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw made by you or a creature that you can see with the value of the borrowed luck roll. You can only have one borrowed luck roll at a time, and you lose any unused borrowed luck rolls when you complete a short or long rest.</p>",
