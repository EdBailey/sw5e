As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.</p>\n<p>If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can&rsquo;t make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a power, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.</p>\n<p>If you succeed on the check and the creature isn&rsquo;t hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.</p>",
