As a part of this bonus action, and as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cast the&nbsp;force jump&nbsp;power at 1st-level without expending force points. Additionally, when you cast&nbsp;force jump, you have advantage on the first attack roll you make against each creature within 5 feet of where you land.</p>\n<p>This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
