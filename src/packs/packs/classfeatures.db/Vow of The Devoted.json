See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.</p>\n<p><strong>Force Powers Known</strong>.&nbsp;You learn 2 force powers of your choice. You learn an additional power at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, and 17th level. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite. You may only learn <em>universal </em>powers in this way.</p>\n<p><strong>Force Points</strong>.&nbsp;Rather than force points, powers you learn through this vow are cast using your focus points, at 1 focus point per power level. You may only cast <em>universal </em>powers in this way.</p>\n<p><strong>Max Power Level</strong>.&nbsp;Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more focus points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels. Your Max Power Level is 1st. It increases to 2nd at 7th level, 3rd at 13th level, and 4th at 17th level. You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Forcecasting Ability</strong>.&nbsp;You use your focus ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. If a power you cast with focus points calls for a saving throw, you use your focus save DC. If a power you cast with focus points calls for an attack roll, you use your focus attack modifier.</p>",
