When you are wielding a Whills weapon, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Whills weapons count as melee weapons for you, and when you make a melee weapon attack with them, you deal kinetic damage equal to your Martial Arts Damage Die.</li>\n<li>When you would make an unarmed strike using your Martial Arts bonus action or as a part of your Flurry of Blows, you can instead attack with a Whills weapon you are wielding. You roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your Whills weapon when attacking in this way. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the monk table.</li>\n<li>When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a Whills weapon, you can instead reload the weapon.</li>\n</ul>",
