When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to hinder the creature, provided they have the appropiate physiology.</p>\n<p>Some of your debilitating strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the debilitating strike&rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Debilitating Strike save DC</strong>&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>BLEEDING WOUND</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to create a lingering wound in the target for one minute. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, at the start of each of the target&rsquo;s turns, it loses 1d6 hit points and repeats this saving throw, ending the effect on a success. This damage can&rsquo;t be reduced in any way.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>CRIPPLING PAIN</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to cause cause distracting pain in the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>HAMPERING SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to hamper the target&rsquo;s movement. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it gains 1 slowed level and it makes Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage until the end of its next turn.</p>\n</blockquote>",
