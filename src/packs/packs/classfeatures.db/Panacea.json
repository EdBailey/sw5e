            "value": "<p>Once you&rsquo;ve reached 17th level, you&rsquo;ve developed the formula to concoct a cure-all miracle solution: a panacea. Over the course of 10 minutes, you can expend rare medical supplies worth 1,000 cr to create your panacea in a simple syringe. The panacea retains its potency for 24 hours. As a bonus action, a creature can use the panacea. Alternatively, as an action, they can administer it to another creature within 5 feet.</p>\n<p>The target has its exhaustion level reduced by one and regains all of its hit points. If the target is diseased, poisoned, paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends.</p>\n<p>Once you create a panacea, you can&rsquo;t create another until you finish a long rest.</p>",
