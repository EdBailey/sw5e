Once on each of your turns, drawing or stowing a blaster no longer requires your object interaction. Additionally, you no longer require a free hand to reload.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, once per turn, when you hit a creature with a ranged weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage. If you also use your Force-Empowered Shots with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Force-Empowered Shots. The damage is the same type as the weapon&rsquo;s damage.</p>",
