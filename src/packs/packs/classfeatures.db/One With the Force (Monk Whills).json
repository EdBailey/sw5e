If you stay in the trance for at least one minute, when you roll initiative, you can make a ranged weapon attack on a number of creatures up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of one) within 30 feet of you when you were in this trance.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>",
