Choose two tech powers of no higher level than your Max Power Level, as shown in the guardian table. The chosen powers count as both universal force powers and tech powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the guardian table.</p>\n<p>You learn two additional powers at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tech powers you know and replace it with another tech power of no higher level than your Max Power Level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
