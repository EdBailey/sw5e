Your form shifts, exaggerating and strengthening your geneticist discoveries for 1 hour. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</li>\n<li>Your Strength score becomes equal to your Intelligence score.</li>\n<li>You gain a bonus to your AC equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded down, minimum of +1) if it doesn&rsquo;t already include that modifier.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can end this effect early on your turn as a bonus action. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>",
