Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and hit the target. Finally, when you hit a creature with the&nbsp;psychic charge&nbsp;force power and the target tries to speak, it takes additional damage equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1), and its voice does not produce sound until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
