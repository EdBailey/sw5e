            "value": "<p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you cast a force power that deals lightning damage, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you cast a damage dealing force power that requires an attack roll or saving throw, you can cause that power to instead deal lightning damage. If the power would call for a saving throw other than Dexterity, it instead calls for a Dexterity saving throw. If you hit with the power, or the target fails the power&rsquo;s saving throw, affected creatures become&nbsp;shocked&nbsp;until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
