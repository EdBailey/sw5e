            "value": "<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn a number of grappling techniques to subdue your opponents. When you hit a creature grappled by you with an unarmed strike and deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a grappling technique.</p>\n<p>Some of your grappling techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the grappling technique&rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Grapple Technique save DC&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>CONSTRICT</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to choke the target into unconsciousness. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the end of your following turn.</p>\n<p>If you maintain this technique for 1 minute, the target falls unconscious for 1 hour. Droids and constructs can not be knocked unconscious in this way.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>DISARM</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to disarm a weapon or other object the target is holding. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it releases the object. If you have a free hand, you can catch the object. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>HIP TOSS</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to throw your target to the ground. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed back 5 feet, knocked prone, and stunned until the start of your next turn. This ends the grapple.</p>\n</blockquote>",
