A creature can only have one barrier active at a time.</p>\n<h4><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL BARRIER</strong></h4>\n<p>You project an environmental barrier that lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. The barrier has a number of hit points equal to the amount rolled on your Potent Aptitude die + your engineer level. Whenever a creature with this barrier takes damage (one of acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, or sonic, chosen by you when you activate the effect), the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the creature takes any remaining damage.</p>\n<h4><strong>PHYSICAL BARRIER</strong></h4>\n<p>You project a physical barrier that lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. The barrier has a number of hit points equal to the amount rolled on your Potent Aptitude die + half your engineer level (rounded down). Whenever a creature with this barrier takes damage (one of energy, ion, or kinetic, chosen by you when you activate the effect), the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the creature takes any remaining damage.</p>",
