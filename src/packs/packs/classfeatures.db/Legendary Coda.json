As an action, you can end your enhanced song in a triumphant blast of power with an effect determined by the song you are playing.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>BATTLE CRESCENDO</strong></h4>\n<p>Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that you can see and that can hear your song. Each must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 14d6 sonic damage and is stunned for 1d4+1 turns. On a success, it takes half damage and isn&rsquo;t stunned. If a creature is killed by this power, its head explodes.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SUPPORT CRESCENDO</strong></h4>\n<p>Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that you can see and that can hear your song. Once in the next minute, each creature can, as a free action in response to taking damage, choose to halve that damage. Additionally, if the damage would reduce them to 0 hit points, they are instead reduced to 1.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>DISRUPTION CRESCENDO</strong></h4>\n<p>Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that you can see and that can hear your song. Each creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 turns. If a creature affected by this feature is damaged in any way, the effect ends for that creature.</p>",
