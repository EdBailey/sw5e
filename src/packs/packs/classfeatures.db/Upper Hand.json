            "value": "<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to user underhanded tactics to gain the upper hand. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to perform an upper hand technique.</p>\n<p>Some of your upper hand techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the technique&rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Upper Hand save DC&nbsp;</strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>BRUTAL HIT</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to knock the target prone while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>LOW BLOW</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to stun the target while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SHANK SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to hamper the target while within 15 feet of it. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, its movement speed is to 0 and it makes Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage until the end of its next turn.</p>\n</blockquote>",
