Choose Smite for Vonil or Shield for Ishu.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>SMITE</strong></h4>\n<p>Once per turn, when your companion is within 10 feet of you and it hits a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and expend force points to have your companion deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon&rsquo;s damage. The additional damage is 1d8 for each point spent in this way. You can&rsquo;t deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused Strikes column of the guardian table.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, your companion must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your companion must be within 60 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SHIELD</strong></h4>\n<p>When your companion is hit by a weapon attack while within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to attempt to divert the attack. When you do so, the damage your companion takes from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) + your guardian level.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, your companion must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your companion must be within 60 feet.</p>\n</blockquote>",
