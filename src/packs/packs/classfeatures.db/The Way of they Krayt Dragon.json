While in this stance, the first time you hit with a melee weapon attack using Strength each turn, you can attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</p>\n<p>This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
