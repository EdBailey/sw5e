Once on each of your turns, you can choose a creature you can see within 120 feet and mark it as your quarry (no action required). For the next hour, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Once per turn, when you hit the target with a weapon attack, you can deal 1d4 additional damage to it of the same type as the weapon&rsquo;s damage. This die changes as you gain scout levels, as shown in the Ranger&rsquo;s Quarry column of the scout table.</li>\n<li>You have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it while it&rsquo;s on the same planet as you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time. Beginning at 5th level, you can use your reaction to mark a creature when it enters your line of sight, provided it is within range of your Ranger&rsquo;s Quarry.</p>\n<p>The duration increases to 8 hours at 9th level and 24 hours at 17th level.</p>",
