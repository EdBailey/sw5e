When the target of your <em>Curse of Objurgation</em> fails a saving throw against one of your maneuvers, you can choose to amplify that maneuver by expending a number of Hit Dice of your choice. The target immediately takes 1d8 psychic damage for every Hit Die spent in this way.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when creatures attempt to use a power like&nbsp;remove curse&nbsp;or other similar abilities to remove a curse you set, they must roll a Wisdom or Charisma check (their choice) against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, their attempt fails, and any force or tech points spent in this way are wasted.</p>",
