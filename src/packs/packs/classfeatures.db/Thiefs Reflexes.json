You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can&rsquo;t use this feature when you are surprised.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you learn to utilize the momentum of your fall to make deadly vertical strikes. Whenever you fall at least 50 feet and land within 5 feet of an enemy creature you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against that creature. If the attack is a Sneak Attack, you can deal three additional weapon dice worth of damage and the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>",
