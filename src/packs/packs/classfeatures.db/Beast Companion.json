            "value": "<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to employ all the knowledge you&rsquo;ve accumulated to forge a powerful bond with your own personal beast companion.</p>\n<p>Choose your beast, which is detailed below. Over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of herbs and food to call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your companion.</p>\n<p>If your beast dies, or you want to bond with a different creature, you must first break the bond with your current beast companion. You may only have one beast companion at a time.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your beast gains a variety of benefits while it is bonded to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The beast obeys your commands as best it can. It acts on your turn, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your beast acts on its own.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your beast&rsquo;s level equals your scholar level, and for each scholar level you gain after 3rd, your beast companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your beast has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature in this class, your beast&rsquo;s abilities also improve. Your beast can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your beast can&rsquo;t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While your beast is the target of your Critical Analysis feature, it gains a bonus to ability checks, armor class, attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded up).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>GENERATING YOUR BEAST</h1>\n<p>Choosing your beast companion is an integral part of being a Zoologist Scholar. Your beast takes a form of your choosing. Alternatively, your GM can choose what form your beast takes based on your environment.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve selected your type of beast, you assign your beast companion&rsquo;s ability scores. Your beast&rsquo;s Intelligence score is 6, and you assign its other ability scores using a limited standard array (16, 14, 14, 12, 10) as you see fit.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>BEAST FEATURES</h2>\n<p>All beasts share the following traits.</p>\n<h4><strong>HIT POINTS</strong></h4>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>Hit Dice:&nbsp;1d4 per beast companion level</li>\n<li>Hit Points at 1st Level:&nbsp;4 + your beast&rsquo;s Constitution modifier</li>\n<li>Hit Points at Higher Levels:&nbsp;1d4 (or 3) + your beast&rsquo;s Constitution modifier per beast level after 1st</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>PROFICIENCIES</strong></h4>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>Languages:&nbsp;Your beast can understand simple commands spoken in two languages of your choice, as well as hand signals, but it can not speak</li>\n<li>Saving Throws:&nbsp;Choose one from Strength, Intelligence, or Charisma, and another from Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom</li>\n<li>Skills:&nbsp;Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, Intimidation, Perception, Performance, Survival, and Stealth</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>FEATURES</strong></h4>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>Armor Class:&nbsp;10 + your beast&rsquo;s Dexterity modifier</li>\n<li>Bestial Traits:&nbsp;Your beast companion has four bestial traits of your choice. It gains an additional trait at 5th level (5), 8th level (6), 11th level (7), 14th level (8), and 17th level (9). Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can exchange one trait for another one.</li>\n<li>Natural Weapon:&nbsp;Your beast companion attacks with a natural weapon, such as claws or a bite. On a hit, it deals 1d4 kinetic damage.</li>\n<li>Size:&nbsp;Tiny</li>\n<li>Speed:&nbsp;20 ft.</li>\n<li>Type:&nbsp;Beast</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>BESTIAL TRAITS</h2>\n<p>The traits are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>AERIAL</strong></h4>\n<p>Your beast companion has a flying speed equal to its walking speed, and opportunity attacks made against it have disadvantage.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>AMPHIBIOUS</strong></h4>\n<p>Your beast companion has a swimming speed equal to its walking speed, and it can breathe air and water.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>BURROWER</strong></h4>\n<p>Your beast companion has a burrowing speed equal to its walking speed, and it has blindsight out to 10 feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>CHARGER</strong></h4>\n<p>If your beast moves at least half its speed straight towards a target before making a melee attack, it deals an additional 1d8 damage on a hit.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>CLIMBER</strong></h4>\n<p>Your beast companion has a climbing speed equal to its walking speed, and it has advantage on Strength saving throws and Strength (Athletics) checks that involve climbing.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>DARKVISION</strong></h4>\n<p>Your beast companion is accustomed to low-light environments.
