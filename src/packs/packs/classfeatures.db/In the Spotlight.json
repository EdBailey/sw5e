As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is marked for 1 minute. While the target is marked, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can add half your Charisma modifier (minimum of one) to any weapon damage roll you make against the marked target that doesn't already include that modifier.</li>\n<li>Your critical hit range against the marked target increases by 1.</li>\nIf the marked target is reduced to 0 hit points, you regain hit points equal to your fighter level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).</ul>\n<p>This effect ends early if you're incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
