The creature's movement speed is doubled until the end of its next turn. Alternatively, it gains a level of slowed until the end of its next turn.</li>\n<li>Focus/Dizziness. The creature has either advantage or disadvantage (your choice) on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes within the next minute.</li>\n<li>Toughen/Weaken. The creature gains temporary hit points equal to your scout level, which last for 1 minute. Alternatively, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failure, it takes psychic damage equal to your scout level and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can use each feature once. You regain any expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>",
