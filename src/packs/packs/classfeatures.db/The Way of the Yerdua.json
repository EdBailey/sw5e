While in this stance, you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1) to one ranged weapon attack and damage roll you make each turn. Additionally, when making a ranged weapon attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\n<p>This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
