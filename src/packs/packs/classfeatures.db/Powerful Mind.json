You can then use your access to the creature&rsquo;s mind to command it.</p>\n<p>As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest. If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about.) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute. During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and use the&nbsp;coerce mind&nbsp;force power on the creature without expending force points. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the power.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>",
