Additionally, you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action. If more than one creature would be affected, and you use your Double Strike feature, only one creature takes the additional damage. Finally, you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of +1) to damage rolls with it, and creatures that succeed on their saving throw take half damage, instead of none.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
