When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you have advantage on the next ranged weapon attack you make against that creature.</li>\n<li>When you roll below half the maximum on a damage die, you can treat the roll as if you&rsquo;d rolled half the maximum on the damage die. You can only affect a number of dice up to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, rounded up, minimum of one) in this way.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die.
