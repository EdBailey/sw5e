When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 force point to use a Force-Empowered Self effect. Each effect uses a d4, which changes as you gain sentinel levels, as shown in the Kinetic Combat column of the sentinel table. You have three such effects: Deflection, Double Strike, and Slow Time. You can only use each effect once per turn, and you can only use one effect per hit.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>DEFLECTION</strong></h4>\n<p>You can roll a Kinetic Combat die and add it to your AC against one attack before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>DOUBLE STRIKE</strong></h4>\n<p>You can roll a Kinetic Combat die and deal additional damage of the same type equal to the amount rolled.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>SLOW TIME</strong></h4>\n<p>You can roll a Kinetic Combat die to increase your speed by 5 x the amount rolled until the end of your turn.</p>\n</blockquote>",
