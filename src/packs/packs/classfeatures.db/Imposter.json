You must spend at least 1 minute studying these three components of the person&rsquo;s behavior: listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms. If you can only study some of these aspects (such as only having writing samples, or only audio recordings), you can mimic that aspect of the person, but not other aspects you have not studied.</p>\n<p>Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.</p>",
