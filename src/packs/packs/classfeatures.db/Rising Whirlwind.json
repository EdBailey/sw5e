            "value": "<p>By 15th level, as an action, you can rush forward up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see without provoking opportunity attacks. Each creature within 5 feet of your path must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with your weapon). A creature takes normal weapon damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If you are wielding separate two light- or vibro-weapons in each hand with which you are proficient, or a weapon with the double property, a creature makes this save with disadvantage, and takes additional damage equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice, minimum of one) on a failed save if it doesn&rsquo;t already include that modifier.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>",
