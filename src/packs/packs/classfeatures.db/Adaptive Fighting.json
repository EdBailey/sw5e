When you use your Adaptive Fighting, you choose which effect to create.</p>\n<p>You can use this features a number of times equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>CHANGE UP</strong></h4>\n<p>You can use your object interaction and expend a use of your Adaptive Fighting to change the Fighting Style option granted to you by your fighter class feature. You can&rsquo;t take a Fighting Style option more than once.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>DRAW</strong></h4>\n<p>When you use your object interaction to draw one or more weapons, you can expend a use of your Adaptive Fighting (no action required) to increase your critical hit range by 1 with the weapon(s) until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>STOW</strong></h4>\n<p>When you use your object interaction to stow a weapon, you can expend a use of your Adaptive Fighting (no action required) to take the Disengage action.</p>\n</blockquote>",
