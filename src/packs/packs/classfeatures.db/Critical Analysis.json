As a bonus action on your turn, you can analyze a target you can see within 60 feet of you. For the next minute, or until you analyze another target, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you analyze a hostile creature, your attack and damage rolls made with weapons with the finesse property or blaster weapons against that target may use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity.</li>\n<li>When you analyze a friendly creature, the target can end your Critical Analysis on them (no action required) to add your Intelligence modifier to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once a friendly creature has benefited from this ability, they can not do so again until they complete a short or long rest.</li>\n</ul>",
