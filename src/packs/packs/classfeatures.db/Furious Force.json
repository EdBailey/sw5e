While raging, you add your rage damage to damage rolls from force powers you cast. If a force power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of the targets.</p>\n<p>Casting force powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage, and you can use your Reckless Attack feature to gain advantage when casting a force power that requires an attack roll.</p>",
