            "value": "<p>At 18th level, you can use your action to make a single melee weapon attack against each creature within your reach. Make a separate attack roll against each target. The first attack gains a +1 bonus to its attack roll, and each attack after the first gains an additional +1 bonus to its attack roll, cumulatively, to a maximum bonus of +6. If you are wielding two light- or vibro-weapons, or a weapon with the double property, you also add this bonus to your damage rolls, and you can use your bonus action to engage in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>",
