The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond, gaining the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can&rsquo;t be disarmed of that weapon while you are conscious.</li>\n<li>If the weapon is within 60 feet of you and you can see it, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to travel instantly to you. If you have a free hand, you catch the weapon. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.</li>\n<li>You can use Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can have two weapons bonded to you in this way at a time, and you can summon both of them to you with the same bonus action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
