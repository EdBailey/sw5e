Any creature partaking in the feast gains the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is cured of all poisons and disease, and becomes immune to poison and disease.</li>\n<li>It makes Wisdom saving throws to avoid being frightened with advantage.</li>\n<li>Its hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 2d10.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These benefits last until the end of the creature&rsquo;s next long rest or 24 hours have passed. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>",
