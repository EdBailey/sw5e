You gain swimming and climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, your Sage Advice feature can be used to give friendly creatures knowledge on how to swim or climb, following the same rules of that feature as if it is a skill or tool. However, the friendly creatures have swimming speed or climbing speed for the entire duration instead.</p>",
