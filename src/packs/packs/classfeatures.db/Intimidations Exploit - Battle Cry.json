Make a Charisma (Intimidation) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the target is frightened until the end of your next turn. If the target was already frightened of you, it must immediately drop whatever it is holding. On its next turn, if it is still frightened of you, it must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on its turn, unless there is nowhere to move. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>",
