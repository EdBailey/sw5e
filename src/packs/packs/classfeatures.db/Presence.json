The additional damage is 1d8 for each point spent in this way. You can&rsquo;t deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused Strikes column of the guardian table.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>BRUTAL STRIKES</strong></h4>\n<p>The Force flowing through you grants you incredible strength. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a Force-Empowered Strikes or Improved Force-Empowered Strikes damage die, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you spend force points to use your Force-Empowered Strikes feature, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice the number of points spent.</p>\n</blockquote>",
