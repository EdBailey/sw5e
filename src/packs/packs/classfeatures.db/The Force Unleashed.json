Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of that point must make a Constitution saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 force damage and suffers 1 level of exhaustion. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and does not suffer exhaustion.</p>\n<p>For each creature that fails this saving throw, a friendly creature within 30 feet of them can regain hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt. A friendly creature can only gain this benefit once per turn.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>",
