If that space is occupied by a Huge or smaller creature or a Medium or smaller unsecured object, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. An object automatically fails this saving throw, and a creature can choose to fail. On a failed save, a Medium or smaller creature or object falls through the portal, immediately appearing in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal and falling prone. A Large or Huge creature instead falls prone without moving.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
