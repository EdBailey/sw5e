As a bonus action, you can stabilize a creature you can touch that has 0 hit points.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as an action, you can tend to a creature you can touch that has died since the end of your last turn. The creature immediately regains 1 hit point and stabilizes. Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>",
