Additionally, you no longer have disadvantage on the attack roll with it if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, and you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and hit a target. Finally, when you hit a creature within with the&nbsp;saber throw&nbsp;force power, you deal additional damage equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, rounded up, minimum of +1) if it doesn't already include that modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
