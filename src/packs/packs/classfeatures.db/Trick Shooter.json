            "value": "<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn a number of trick shots you can use to debilitate enemies and impress allies. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a trick shot.</p>\n<p>Some of your trick shots require your target to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot&rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Trick Shot save DC&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>BLINDING SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to blind the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>BRUTAL SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to knock the target prone. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>HAMPERING SHOT</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to hobble the enemy&rsquo;s movement. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, its movement speed is reduced by half and it makes Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage until the end of its next turn.</p>\n</blockquote>",
