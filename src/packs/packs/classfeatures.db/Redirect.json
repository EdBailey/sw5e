If the weapon or power required a melee or ranged attack, make a melee or ranged force attack against the new target, as appropriate. If it required a Dexterity saving throw, the new target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>",
