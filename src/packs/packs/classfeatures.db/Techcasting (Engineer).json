See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.</p>\n<h4><strong>TECH POWERS KNOWN</strong></h4>\n<p>You learn 6 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the engineer table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.</p>\n<h4><strong>TECH POINTS</strong></h4>\n<p>You have a number of tech points equal to your engineer level x 2, as shown in the Tech Points column of the engineer table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h4><strong>MAX POWER LEVEL</strong></h4>\n<p>Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the engineer table.</p>\n<p>You may only cast tech powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\n<h4><strong>TECHCASTING ABILITY</strong></h4>\n<p>Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Tech save DC</strong>&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Tech attack modifier</strong>&nbsp;= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TECHCASTING FOCUS</strong></h4>\n<p>You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) or your tool proficiencies granted by this class as a techcasting focus for your tech powers.</p>",
