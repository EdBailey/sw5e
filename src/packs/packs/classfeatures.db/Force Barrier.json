When you cast a universal power of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously manipulate the Force to create a barrier on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The barrier has hit points equal to twice your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). Your barrier can never have hit points greater than twice your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).</p>\n<p>Whenever you take damage, the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.</p>\n<p>While the barrier has 0 hit points, it can&rsquo;t absorb damage, but its power remains. Whenever you cast a universal power of 1st level or higher, the barrier regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the power.</p>\n<p>Once you create the barrier, you can&rsquo;t create it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
