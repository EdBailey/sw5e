If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).</p>\n<p>When you finish a long rest, you reduce your exhaustion level by 2 rather than 1. Additionally, any effect that removes exhaustion reduces your exhaustion by 1 additional level.</p>",
