For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + your prof-iciency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, it can&rsquo;t attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your powers on your next turn.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>",
