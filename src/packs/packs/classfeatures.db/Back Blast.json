Additionally, when a creature fails a saving throw against the burst or rapid property of a weapon you control and with which you are proficient, you can apply your Sneak Attack damage to one creature dealt damage in this way as long as that creature didn&rsquo;t have advantage on the save.</p>\n<p>When you reach 9th level in this class, when multiple creatures fail a saving throw against the burst property of a weapon you control and with which you are proficient, you can divide your Sneak Attack dice amongst the targets as you see fit.</p>",
