If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to ward the creature if you&rsquo;re wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll 1d8 and add the number rolled to the target&rsquo;s AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack&rsquo;s damage.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>",
