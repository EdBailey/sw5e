You can add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you don&rsquo;t need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if no creature other than your target is within 5 feet of you, as long as the target of the attack is within 5 feet of you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.</p>\n<p>Finally, during your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can&rsquo;t make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.</p>",
