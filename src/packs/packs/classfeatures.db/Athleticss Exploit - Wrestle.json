Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target&rsquo;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, the target is both grappled and restrained by you. If the target stops being grappled, it also stops being restrained. If your check fails, you can&rsquo;t use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.</p>",
