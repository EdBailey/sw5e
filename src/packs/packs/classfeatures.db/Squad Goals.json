When seeing you take damage from an enemy's attack, a number of allies equal to your charisma modifier within 60 feet of you that can see you may immediately make a single attack of opportunity against the enemy, no action required. You may use this feature once, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
