You gain the following benefits while you aren&rsquo;t wearing heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your damage die for your unarmed strikes and natural weapons increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).</li>\n<li>You can deal Sneak Attack damage when making an unarmed strike. Additionally, you don&rsquo;t need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if the target of your Sneak Attack is a creature grappled by you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.</li>\n<li>You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make an unarmed strike against a creature you are grappling.</li>\n</ul>",
