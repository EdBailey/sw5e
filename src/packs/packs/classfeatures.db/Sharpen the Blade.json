As a bonus action, you can expend up to 3 focus points to grant one Echani weapon you touch a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. The bonus equals the number of points you spent. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again. This feature has no effect on an enhanced weapon that already has a bonus to attack and damage rolls.</p>",
