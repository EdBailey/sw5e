This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the monk table.</li>\n<li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength whenever you would make a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple, shove, or trip a creature.</li>\n<li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.</li>\n<li>You can take the Dash and Disengage actions as a bonus action.</li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h4><strong>Variant: Monks with Lightweapons</strong></h4>\n<p>If monks gain lightweapon proficiency, consider letting them use lightweapons as monk weapons, provided the lightweapon has a vibroweapon analogue. For instance, chakrams count as monk weapons. If a monk gains proficiency in a light ring, they could also use it as a monk weapon.</p>\n</section>",
