            "value": "<p><em><strong>Monk: Kro Var Order:&nbsp;17th level</strong></em></p>\n<p>As an ultimate display of your mastery of the elements, you can spend 5 focus points as an action to have the elements of water, earth, fire, and air form a protective sphere around your body, gaining multiple benefits for 1 minute. While this ability is active, you have resistance to cold, energy, fire, kinetic, lightning, and sonic damage. You also gain a burrow, fly, and swim speed equal to your movement speed. Lastly, you can use any of the following abilities as a bonus action:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You create a small earthquake on the ground in a 15 foot radius around you. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1 d6 kinetic damage and is knocked prone.</li>\n<li>You create a line of fire 15 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>\n<li>You create a 15 foot cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 1 d10 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a Large or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.</li>\n<li>You create a 15 foot cone of ice shards extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution save throw. A creature takes 2d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect has its speed halved until the start of your next turn.</li>\n</ul>",
