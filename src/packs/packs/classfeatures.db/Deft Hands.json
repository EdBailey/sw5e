            "value": "<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn a number of techniques to distract and confuse your opponents. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to perform a deft hand maneuver.</p>\n<p>Some of your aerial maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the deft hand maneuver&rsquo;s effects. The saving throw DC is as follows:</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Deft Hands save DC</strong>&nbsp;= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<h4><strong>HINDER</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to distract your target in order to hinder their movement. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it gains 1 slowed level until the end of its next turn and it makes the first Dexterity saving throw before the end of its next turn with disadvantage.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>PILFER</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to pick your target&rsquo;s pockets. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you have advantage on the first Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check you make against the target before the end of your next turn.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>TUMBLE</strong></h4>\n<p>You attempt to nimbly roll away. You immediately move 10 feet in a direction of your choice, and the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from the creature.</p>\n</blockquote>",
