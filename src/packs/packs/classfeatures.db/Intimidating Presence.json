If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.</p>\n<p>If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, it becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.</p>",
