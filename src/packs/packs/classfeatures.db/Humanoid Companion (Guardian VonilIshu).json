Bonding with a new companion takes 8 hours spent in an appropriate location. You may only have one companion at a time.</p>\n<p>In addition to its traits and features, your companion gains additional benefits while it is bonded to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your companion gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your force point maximum is reduced by 2.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lastly, while bonded and within 10 feet of you, when you or your companion are hit by dealt damage by an external effect, you can choose to have you or your companion gain resistance to that damage. If you do so, the other of the two takes the same damage. This damage can&rsquo;t be reduced or negated in any way.</p>\n<p>At 11th level, your companion must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your companion must be within 60 feet.</p>",
