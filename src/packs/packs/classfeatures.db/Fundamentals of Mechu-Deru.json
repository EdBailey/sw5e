            "value": "<p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you&rsquo;ve dabbled in adapting your use of the Force, melding it with technology. You gain proficiency in the Technology skill, as well as simple blasters. When you cast a force power that calls for a melee weapon attack, and you are wielding a blaster with which you are proficient, you can instead make a ranged weapon attack, as long as the target is within your weapon&rsquo;s normal range.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you&rsquo;ve learned to manipulate the Force to be able to manipulate technology when it couldn&rsquo;t previously. When you cast a force power that could not affect droids or constructs, you can choose to have it affect droids or constructs. If it would affect multiple targets, you must expend additional uses of this feature for each additional target. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>",
