That creature may immediately use its reaction to make one melee weapon attack, adding your Strength modifier to the attack&rsquo;s damage roll.</p>\n<h4><strong>THROW FOE</strong></h4>\n<p>If the creature is an opponent, you throw the target into any unoccupied space within 30 feet, where it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier and falls prone.</p>",
