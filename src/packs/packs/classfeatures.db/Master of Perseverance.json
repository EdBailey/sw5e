Your maximum for these scores increases by 2.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage from unenhanced weapons.</li>\n<li>Once per turn, when you hit with a melee weapon attack using Strength, you can use your Force-Empowered Strikes feature at 1st-level without expending force points. You gain temporary hit points equal to the extra damage dealt.</li>\n<li>When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to make a single weapon attack with advantage against that creature. If the attack hits, you impose disadvantage on the triggering attack roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you&rsquo;ve used this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>",
