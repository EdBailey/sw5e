When you do so, the chosen creatures have resistance to damage dealt by traps.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>GALACTIC EXPLORER</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;9th level</span><br />When you make a Piloting (Intelligence) skill check and may add your proficiency bonus to the check, treat any roll of 9 or lower as if you had rolled a 10.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>GRAPPLING HUNTER</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;5th level</span><br />Attack rolls that you make against creatures that you are grappling have advantage.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>HIGH GROUND</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><strong>Prerequisite</strong>:&nbsp;5th level</span><br />Once per turn, when you or a friendly creature hits a creature that is a target of your Critical Analysis feature, it takes additional damage equal to your half Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>NO STONE LEFT UNTURNED</strong></h4>\n<p>When you make a Wisdom (Perception) or Investigation (Intelligence) check to find a hidden creature that is inside the area that is targeted by your Critical Analysis feature, you do so with advantage.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>VERSATILE EXPLORER</strong></h4>\n<p>You can hold your breath twice as long as you are normally able to, and take half as much damage from fall damage.</p>\n</blockquote>",
