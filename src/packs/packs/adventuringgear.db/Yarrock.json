            "value": "<p>Yarrock is a strong hallucinogen which is said to instill a creature with a clear vision of \u201cthe meaning of life\u201d, granting a boost to confidence. As an action, you can apply this substance to a creature within 5 feet. For the next minute, the creature experiences a high that allows them to roll an additional d4 when making an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw using Charisma. At the end of the high, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or experience a low that lasts 10 minutes, during which they must roll a d4 and subtract the result when making an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw using Charisma. At the end of the low, the creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to resist addiction.</p>",
