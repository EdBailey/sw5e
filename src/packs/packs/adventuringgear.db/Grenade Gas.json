            "value": "<p>Gas grenades are primarily used to flush enemies out of cover and other protected areas, though there are of course other uses. Grenades have a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. As an action, you can throw a grenade at a point you can see within range. The grenade explodes in a 15-foot-radius sphere of yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses it.</p>\n<p>When a creature enters the fog\u2019s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 1d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is poisoned while it is in the cloud. Droids, constructs and humanoids wearing appropriate protective equipment are unaffected.</p>",
