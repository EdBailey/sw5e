For the next minute, the creature experiences a high that allows them to roll an additional d4 when making an ability check or saving throw using Constitution, and at the start of each of the creature\u2019s turns it gains 2d4 temporary hit points. At the end of the high, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or experience a low that lasts 10 minutes, during which they must roll a d4 and subtract the result when making an ability check or saving throw using Contitution, and for the duration their current and maximum hit points are reduced by 2d4. At the end of the low, the creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw to resist addiction.</p>",
