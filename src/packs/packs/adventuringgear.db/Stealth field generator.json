            "value": "<p>Stealth field generators are special devices typically worn on belts that function as a portable, personal cloaking device. Activating or deactivating the generator requires a bonus action and, while active, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) ability checks that rely on sight. The generator lasts for 1 minute and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cell. This effect ends early if you make an attack or cast a force- or tech- power.</p>",
