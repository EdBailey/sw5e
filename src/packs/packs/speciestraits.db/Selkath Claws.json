            "value": "Your claws are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal kinetic damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier. You can use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can perform a special claw attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack\u2019s normal effects, and it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the target is poisoned until the end of its next turn, and you can\u2019t use this feature again until you complete a short or long rest.",
