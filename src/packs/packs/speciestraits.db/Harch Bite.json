Additionally, as a bonus action, you can perform a special bite attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack\u2019s normal effects, and it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the target is poisoned until the end of its next turn, and you can\u2019t use this feature again until you complete a short or long rest.",
