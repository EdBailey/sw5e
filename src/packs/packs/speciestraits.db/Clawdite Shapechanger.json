You can also adjust your height and weight, but not so much that your size changes. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your game statistics change. You can\u2019t duplicate the appearance of a creature you\u2019ve never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren\u2019t changed by this trait. You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.",
