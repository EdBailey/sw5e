Do you crave the thrill of lawbreaking, or did you enter the profession to pay off a debt, risking your hide on behalf of a less than honorable noble? A smuggler is an individual trained in the art of acquisition, a professional thug who can deliver anything... for a price. Smugglers tend to be more bolder criminals than most, preferring bribery or distraction over subterfuge and stealth."
