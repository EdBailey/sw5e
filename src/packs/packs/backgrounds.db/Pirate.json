However, you still have contacts within the criminal underworld and you're far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of finer society."

The same circumstances that give them their edge can also grind them down, leaving them vulnerable to greed, shame, and the scars of fear and horror left by battle."

You can expect your former comrades to offer you passage aboard ship, reasonable aid, or shelter when you are in need. Keep in mind that this bond goes both ways, and they may come to you expecting the same."
