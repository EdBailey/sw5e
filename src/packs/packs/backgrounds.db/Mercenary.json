You can find the cantinas and feasthalls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the language, and if you spend at least an hour in such a location you can come across one of the following bits of information: a job offer, significant rumor, referal to a skilled merchant, blacksmith, etc., or a hint towards the pursuit of your current quest. Additionally, you can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see \"Practicing a Profession\" under \"Downtime Activities\" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook)."
