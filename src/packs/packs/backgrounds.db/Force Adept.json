With proper training, you could learn to consciously sense and manipulate that energy further.  As it is, you may appear to have heightened senses, extremely quick reflexes, an intuitive understanding of others, or an uncanny ability to persuade people to your way of thinking. Your powers may have lain dormant for a long time, perhaps you felt something inside of you but never knew what it was. Perhaps your abilities were awoken by a strong encounter with another force-sensitive with the powers of the Force, or an object associated with the Force, such as a lightsaber."
