            "value": "<h1>Astrotech Engineering</h1>\n<p>Those engineers who choose the Astrotech Engineering discipline focus on crafting and upgrading their droid companions.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>When you choose this discipline at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in astrotech's tools. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with astrotech's tools, the rate at which you craft doubles.</p>\n<h2>Droid Companion</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to create and customize your own personalized droid companion.</p>\n<p>Choose your droid, which is detailed at the end of this discipline. Over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of materials to finally finish your droid.</p>\n<p>If your droid is irreparably destroyed, or you want to interface with a different droid, you can spend an additional 250 credits and 1 hour to change the target of this feature. You may only have one droid companion at a time.</p>\n<p>Your droid gains a variety of benefits while it is interfaced with you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The droid obeys your commands as best it can. It acts on your turn, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your droid acts on its own.</li>\n<li>Your droid's level equals your engineer level, and for each engineer level you gain after 3rd, your droid companion gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.</li>\n<li>Your droid has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.</li>\n<li>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature in this class, your droid's abilities also improve. Your droid can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your droid can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.</li>\n<li>Your droid can not wear armor, but you can have the armor professionally integrated into its chassis. Over the course of a long rest, you can expend materials equal to half the cost of the armor in order to integrate it into your droid. Your droid must be proficient in armor in order to have it integrated.</li>\n<li>Your droid is a valid target of the <em>tracker droid interface</em> tech power.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, you can modify your droid. Your droid companion has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer class table. For each modification installed, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\n<h2>Potent Integration</h2>\n<p>Lastly at 3rd level, when your droid makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to give it a boost. Roll the die and add it to both the attack and damage rolls, if the attack hits.</p>\n<h2>Coordinated Attack</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, when you take the Attack action, if your companion can see you, it can use its reaction to make a weapon attack against the same creature.</p>\n<h2>Droid Defense</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, while your droid can see you, it has advantage on all saving throws.</p>\n<h2>Superior Droid Defense</h2>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, whenever an attacker that your droid can see hits it with an attack, it can use its reaction to halve the attack's damage against it.</p>\n<h2>Generating Your Droid</h2>\n<p>Choosing your droid companion is an integral part of being an Astrotech Engineer. The class of droid you choose determines their features. Class II, III, and IV droids are all appropriate options, with their statistics listed below.</p>\n<p>Once you've selected your type of droid class, you assign your droid's ability scores using standard array (16, 14, 14, 12, 10, 8) as you see fit.</p>\n<h2>Droid Features</h2>\n<p>All droids share the following features.</p>\n<h3>Resistances and Vulnerabilities</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Droid Resistances:</strong> Your droid is resistant to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage, and immune to poison and disease.</li>\n<li><strong>Droid Vulnerabilities:</strong> Your droid is vulnerable to ion damage. Additionally, your droid has disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal ion or lightning damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Creature Type:</strong> Droid</li>\n<li><strong>Armor Integration:</strong> Your droid can not wear armor, but you can have the armor professionally integrated into its chassis. Over the course of a long rest, you can expend materials equal to half the cost of the armor in order to have it integrated. This work must be done by someone proficient with astrotech's tools. Your droid must be proficient in armor in order to have it integrated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Class I Droid</h2>\n<p>Class I droids are programmed for the mathematical, medical, or physical sciences.
