            "value": "<h1>Way of Lightning</h1>\n<p>Of all of the dark arts of the Force, little can match the spectacle and devastation of Force lightning. Those consulars who follow the Way of Lightning summon intense discharges of pure Force energy, overwhelming enemies with punishing damage from a distance, leaving them shaken and vulnerable&mdash;if not dead.</p>\n<h2>Shocking Affinity</h2>\n<p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you cast a force power that deals lightning damage, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you cast a damage dealing force power that requires an attack roll or saving throw, you can cause that power to instead deal lightning damage. If the power would call for a saving throw other than Dexterity, it instead calls for a Dexterity saving throw. If you hit with the power, or the target fails the power's saving throw, affected creatures become <em>shocked</em> until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Potent Lightning</h2>\n<p>At 6th level you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of +1) to any damage you deal with force powers that deal lightning damage.</p>\n<h2>Blistering Rebuke</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 10th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 plus your consular level lightning damage, is pushed back 10 feet, and becomes <em>shocked</em> until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't moved or <em>shocked</em>.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Electric Attunement</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, you gain resistance to lightning damage. Additionally, force powers you cast ignore resistance to lightning damage.</p>\n<h2>Unlimited Power</h2>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, you can increase the power of your simpler lightning force powers. When you cast a force power of 6th-level or lower that deals lightning damage, you can deal maximum damage with that power.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature with no adverse effects a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). If you use this feature beyond this before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the power, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per power level increases by 1d12. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.</p>"
