            "value": "<h1>Frenzied Approach</h1>\n<p>For some berserkers, rage is a means to an end\u2014that end being violence. The Frenzied Approach is that of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker\u2019s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.</p>\n<h2>Frenzy</h2>\n<p>When you choose this approach at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).</p>\n<p>When you finish a long rest, you reduce your exhaustion level by 2 rather than 1. Additionally, any effect that removes exhaustion reduces your exhaustion by 1 additional level.</p>\n<h2>Maniacal Rage</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, while raging, when you make a Charisma (Intimidation) check, or a creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to avoid being frightened of you, you add your Strength modifier to the check or save DC, as appropriate.</p>\n<h2>Mindless Rage</h2>\n<p>At 6th level, you can\u2019t be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.</p>\n<h2>Intimidating Presence</h2>\n<p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On sub-sequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.</p>\n<p>If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can\u2019t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>Retaliation</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.</p>"
