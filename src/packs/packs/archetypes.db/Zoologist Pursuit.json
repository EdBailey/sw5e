            "value": "<h1>Zoologist Pursuit</h1>\n<p>Many academics develop an affinity for nature, studying the vast fauna that inhabit the different planets throughout the galaxy. Those scholars who choose the Zoologist Pursuit capitalize on their knowledge of animals, developing a strong bond with a companion with whom they gain an advantage on the battlefield.</p>\n<h2>Wilderness Expert</h2>\n<p>When you choose this pursuit at 3rd level, you gain proficiency your choice of Animal Handling or Nature skills. Additionally, when you make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h2>Beast Companion</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to forge a powerful bond with your own personal beast companion.</p>\n<p>Choose your beast, which is detailed at the end of this pursuit. Over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of herbs and food to call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your companion.</p>\n<p>If your beast dies, or you want to bond with a different creature, you must first break the bond with your current beast companion. You may only have one beast companion at a time.</p>\n<p>Your beast gains a variety of benefits while it is bonded to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The beast obeys your commands as best it can. It acts on your turn, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your beast acts on its own.</li>\n<li>Your beast's level equals your scholar level, and for each scholar level you gain after 3rd, your beast companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.</li>\n<li>Your beast has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.</li>\n<li>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature in this class, your beast's abilities also improve. Your beast can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your beast can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.</li>\n<li>While your beast is the target of your Critical Analysis feature, it gains a bonus to ability checks, armor class, attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded up).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Additional Maneuvers</h2>\n<p>Lastly at 3rd level, you gain access to new maneuvers which reflect the progress of your studies into the biology and behavior of animals. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Loyal Bond</h3>\n<p>Whenever you are hit with an attack, you can expend one superiority die to command your companion to immediately use its reaction and move up to its speed directly towards you. If it ends this movement within 5 feet of you, roll the superiority die. Your companion takes the damage instead of you, subtracting the amount you rolled from the total.</p>\n<h3>Go Get 'Em</h3>\n<p>While your companion is moving, you can expend a superiority die and add 5 times the number rolled to its movement speed.</p>\n<h3>Pin Down</h3>\n<p>When your beast attempts to grapple or knock a creature prone, you can expend a superiority die to give it direction as long as it can see or hear you. Roll a superiority die and add it to your beast's Strength (Athletics) check.</p>\n<h3>Primal Endurance</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can expend a superiority die to improve your beast's defense. Roll the die and add it to your beast's AC until the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Sic 'Em</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can command your beast to savage a nearby enemy. Your beast can use its reaction to immediately move up to 10 feet and make one attack, adding the superiority dice to the damage roll on a hit.</p>\n<h3>Spine-Chilling Howls</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can expend one superiority die to command your beast to frighten another creature. The target must then succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Maneuver save DC or become frightened of both you and your beast for 1 minute.</p>\n<h3>Wild Senses</h3>\n<p>Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) or a Wisdom (Survival) check, you can request the aid of your beast by expending a superiority die, adding the number rolled to the check. You can use this maneuver before or after making the ability check, but before the results of the ability check are determined.</p>\n<h2>Vicious Hunting</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, your beast companion's strikes count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.</p>\n<h2>Creature Comprehension</h2>\n<p>Starting at 9th level, when your beast makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you may expend a superiority die and apply the benefits of a maneuver you know from this class, as if you have taken the action yourself.</p>\n<h2>Feral Ferocity</h2>\n<p>Once you've reached 17th level, you have learned how to push your beast beyond its limits. If your beast is within 30 feet of you and can see or hear you, you can command it to enter a furious state. While raging, your beast gains the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your beast has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws if it is size Medium or larger.</li>\n<li>Your beast has advantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws if it is size Small or smaller.</li>\n<li>When your hits with an attack, it deals bonus damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.</li>\n<li>Your beast has resistance to kinetic and energy damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your beast's furious state lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if your beast is knocked unconscious. You can end your beast's furious state as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Discoveries (Zoologist)</h2>\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your studies in biology and behaviour of alien lifeforms.

You can attempt to extend the duration by one hour by making additional Animal Handling checks. The DC for the first check is 20, and increases by 5 on each subsequent check. On a failure, the creature becomes hostile to you if it wasn't already and becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.</p>\n<h3>Holocam Attachment</h3>\n<p>You have learned how to safely attach a holocam on the head of the companion.
