            "value": "<h1>Explorer Pursuit</h1>\n<p>The explorer strives to navigate past the known to discover new planets, forgotten ruins, or forbidden locations. Those scholars who choose the Explorer Pursuit spend their time studying maps, landmarks, architecture blue prints, or even history books, using them to effectively lead the way for their companions.</p>\n<h2>Focused Navigator</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 3rd level when you select this pursuit, you gain proficiency in two of the Perception, Piloting, Survival, and Acrobatics skills.</p>\n<h2>Surveyed Area</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, you can now use your Critical Analysis feature on a 15-foot cube area within 60 feet of you that you can see. You can treat any creatures inside this cube as if they are the target of your Critical Analysis feature, and when a creature ends your Critical Analysis feature on themself, it does not end this effect for other creatures in your Surveyed Area.</p>\n<h2>Additional Maneuvers</h2>\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new maneuvers which reflect your studies in maps and hidden routes. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Effective Flanking</h3>\n<p>Whenever you use your Critical Analysis ability, you can expend a superiority die to make all creatures of your choice affected by Critical Analysis to make a Wisdom saving throw. If at least one creature fails the save, roll a superiority die.</p>\n<p>On a failed save, the number rolled is added to both the attack and damage roll for the first attack against the creature before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Encouraging Pace</h3>\n<p>You can use a bonus action to expend a superiority die. When you do so, a number of friendly creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier can immediately use their reaction to move a number of feet equal to 5 times the number rolled on the superiority die.</p>\n<h3>No Escape</h3>\n<p>Whenever you or a creature you can see makes an opportunity attack, you can expend a superiority die. If the attack hits, roll the superiority die and add the result to the damage roll. Additionally, the affected creature's movement speed becomes 0 until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<h3>Precise Movements</h3>\n<p>When you or a friendly creature you can see that can see or hear you moves, you can expend a superiority die to give them verbal guidance and encouragement. Roll a superiority die. The creature's speed increases by 5 times the number rolled, and they can move through the space of hostile creatures as if it were difficult terrain.</p>\n<h3>Snare Traps</h3>\n<p>You can use an action and expend a superiority die to trigger painful snare traps. When you do, one creature within 60 feet of you or all creatures that are targeted by your Critical Analysis has to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your maneuver save DC.</p>\n<p>On a failure, they take damage equal to the roll and their movement speed becomes 0 until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Superior Counterattack</h3>\n<p>Whenever an opportunity attack targets a friendly creature other than you that is in an area targeted by your Critical Analysis feature, you can expend a superiority die. The creature can use its reaction to make a single weapon attack, adding the superiority die roll to the attack roll.</p>\n<h3>Wrestle and Drag</h3>\n<p>When you or a creature that is the target of your Critical Analysis makes an Strength (Athletics) check to grapple or shove a creature, you can expend a superiority die and add it to the roll. Until the end of your turn, you can drag the grappled creature with you without your speed being halved. Additionally, if you move at least 5 feet, the creature takes damage for each foot moved up to an amount equal to half your Scholar level + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h2>Field Advantage</h2>\n<p>At 6th level, you learn to quickly convey spatial information in the midst of combat about the area you analyzed, giving them an edge at maneuvering in the area. While moving through your Surveyed Area, you and friendly creatures of your choice ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and opportunity attacks against them are made with disadvantage.</p>\n<h2>Unstoppable Adventurer</h2>\n<p>At 9th level, you learn to swim and scale vertical surfaces with ease. You gain swimming and climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, your Sage Advice feature can be used to give friendly creatures knowledge on how to swim or climb, following the same rules of that feature as if it is a skill or tool. However, the friendly creatures have swimming speed or climbing speed for the entire duration instead.</p>\n<h2>Survey Master</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 17th level, when you use the Surveyed Area feature, the area affected is a 30-foot cube instead of a 15-foot cube.</p>\n<h2>Discoveries (Explorer)</h2>\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your studies in maps and hidden routes. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Cover Adept</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 12th level</em></p>\n<p>You treat half cover as three-quarters cover, and three-quarters cover as full cover. Additionally, while you are in cover, Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make gain a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\n<h3>Dungeon Explorer</h3>\n<p>You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and Intelligence (Investigation) checks to locate any secret doors or traps, and you have resistance to damage dealt by traps.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can use your Sage Advice feature to teach friendly creatures about various types of traps, following the same rules of that feature. When you do so, the chosen creatures have resistance to damage dealt by traps.</p>\n<h3>Galactic Explorer</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p>When you make a Piloting (Intelligence) skill check and may add your proficiency bonus to the check, treat any roll of 9 or lower as if you had rolled a 10.</p>\n<h3>Grappling Hunter</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p>Attack rolls that you make against creatures that you are grappling have advantage.</p>\n<h3>High Ground</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p>Once per turn, when you or a friendly creature hits a creature that is a target of your Critical Analysis feature, it takes additional damage equal to your half Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\n<h3>No Stone Left Unturned</h3>\n<p>When you make a Wisdom (Perception) or Investigation (Intelligence) check to find a hidden creature that is inside the area that is targeted by your Critical Analysis feature, you do so with advantage.</p>\n<h3>Versatile Explorer</h3>\n<p>You can hold your breath twice as long as you are normally able to, and take half as much damage from fall damage.</p>"
