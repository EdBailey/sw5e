They can inspire their allies with renewed vigor, lifting them to new heights, while simultaneously protecting them from harm.</p>\n<h2>Techcasting</h2>\n<p>When you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.</p>\n<h3>Tech Powers Known</h3>\n<p>You learn 4 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Shield Specialist Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.</p>\n<h3>Tech Points</h3>\n<p>You have a number of tech points equal to half of your fighter level (rounded up), as shown in the Tech Points column of the Shield Specialist Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Max Power Level</h3>\n<p>Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Shield Specialist Techcasting table.</p>\n<p>You may only cast tech powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Techcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Tech save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Tech attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h3>Techcasting Focus</h3>\n<p>You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) as a techcasting focus for your tech powers.</p>\n<div class=\"classtable\">\n<blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: #000000; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: 'Russo One'; background-color: #bdc8cc; font-size: 16px;\" colspan=\"6\"><em>Shield Specialist Techcasting</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\">Level</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Tech Powers Known</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Tech Points</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Max Power Level</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">3rd</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">4th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">5th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">6th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">6</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">7th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">7</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">8th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">8</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">9th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">9</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">10th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">10</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">11th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">11</td>\n<td align=\"center\">6</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">12th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">12</td>\n<td align=\"center\">6</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">13th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">13</td>\n<td align=\"center\">7</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">14th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">14</td>\n<td align=\"center\">7</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">15th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">15</td>\n<td align=\"center\">8</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">16th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">16</td>\n<td align=\"center\">8</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">17th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">17</td>\n<td align=\"center\">9</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">18th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">18</td>\n<td align=\"center\">9</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">19th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">19</td>\n<td align=\"center\">10</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">20th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">20</td>\n<td align=\"center\">10</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<h2>Rallying Cry</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 7th level, you learn how to inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries. When you use your Second Wind feature, you can choose up to three creatures within 60 feet of you that are allied with you. Each one regains hit points equal to your fighter level, provided that the creature can see or hear you.</p>\n<h2>Inspiring Surge</h2>\n<p>At 10th level, when you use your Action Surge feature, you can choose one creature within 60 feet of you that is allied with you. That creature can make one melee or ranged weapon attack with its reaction, provided that it can see or hear you.</p>\n<h2>Bulwark</h2>\n<p>Starting at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of your Indomitable feature to an ally. When you decide to use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its saving throw against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.</p>\n<h2>Greater Inspiring Surge</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, you can choose two allies within 60 feet of you, rather than one, when you using your Inspiring Surge feature.</p>"
