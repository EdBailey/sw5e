            "value": "<h1>Path of Communion</h1>\n<p>Those who master the Force can transcend death, persisting beyond their natural experation. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Communion bond with a Force ghost, developing a symbiotic relationship which alters the way they perceive their surroundings.</p>\n<h2>Mystical Connection</h2>\n<p>Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the @Compendium[sw5e.forcepowers.Pf4e5uRdTd4VuUjU]{Feedback} force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use your Kinetic Combat feature when you cast it as your action. Finally, when you deal psychic damage with the <em>feedback</em> force power, you deal additional psychic damage equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) if it doesn't already include that modifier.</p>\n<h2>Symbiote Spirit</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you attract the attention of the spirit of a Force ghost. Over the course of one hour, you can attune to the spirit, forging a lasting connection. While attuned to a spirit, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your spirit is always audible and visible to you. Your spirit can choose to make itself audible and visible or inaudible and invisible to other creatures (no action required), but it is always visible to beings with truesight.</li>\n<li>Your spirit can not interact with the corporeal world, but it is also not impeded by unenhanced walls or barriers.</li>\n<li>Your spirit acts independently of you, and it only obeys your commands if it chooses to. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. Your spirit can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</li>\n<li>While your spirit is within 100 feet of you, you can telepathically communicate with it. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your spirit's vision and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</li>\n<li>When you cast a force power with a range of touch, your spirit can deliver the power as if it had cast it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the power when you cast it. If the power requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can only attune to one spirit at a time. If you attempt to attune to another spirit, you immediately break the bond with your current spirit.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><em>Generating Your Spirit</em></h3>\n<p><em>Your spirit might be the ghost of a benevolent Jedi, discovered in the ruins of a Jedi temple, or a powerful Sith spirit lingering in an ancient artifact. It might be the spirit of a Nightsister sorceress, or a paragon of a long-forgotten monastic order. Work with your GM to determine the nature of your spirit.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, your spirit can briefly interact with the physical world. When you would make a melee attack, your spirit can deliver the attack as if it had made it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the attack. It uses your modifiers for the attack and damage rolls. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Invasive Presence</h2>\n<p>At 7th level, your spirit can invade another creature's being. As an action, your spirit can touch a creature within 5 feet of it, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.</p>\n<p>On a failed save, your spirit moves into that creatures space, inhabiting its body, for 1 minute. The affected creature has disadvantage on the first attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes each turn. At the end of each its turns, the creature repeats this save. On a success, it repels the spirit from its body, and it becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2>Ethereal Vision</h2>\n<p>By 13th level, you and your guiding spirit both gain truesight out to 60 feet as long as your spirit is within 100 feet of you.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you use your action to see through your spirit's senses, you are no longer deaf and blind with regard to your own senses, able to comprehend what happens in both perspectives simultaneously.</p>\n<h2>Assuming Direct Control</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against your Invasive Presence feature, the target becomes charmed by you for as long as Invasive Presence is active.</p>\n<p>While the target is charmed, you and your spirit have a telepathic link with it as long as you are within 100 feet of it. You and your spirit can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as \"Attack that creature,\" \"Run over there,\" or \"Fetch that object.\" If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.</p>\n<p>You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.</p>"
