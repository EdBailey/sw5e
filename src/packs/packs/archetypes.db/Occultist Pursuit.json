            "value": "<h1>Occultist Pursuit</h1>\n<p>Occultists research the obscure practitioners of mystical arts, from witches to shamans to sorcerers. Those scholars who choose the Occultist Pursuit learn to harness these magics to bewitch and confound their enemies.</p>\n<h2>Rancor's Disposition</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Occultist Pursuit:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>When you use a scholar class feature, or a feature of this archetype, and that feature references your Intelligence modifier, you can substitute your choice of Wisdom or Charisma instead.</p>\n<h2>Curse of Objurgation</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Occultist Pursuit:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>When you target a creature with your Critical Analysis, you can choose one ability. While it can see you, the target has disadvantage on ability checks made with the chosen ability.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scholar table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Additional Maneuvers</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Occultist Pursuit:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\n<p>You gain access to new maneuvers which reflect the progress of your studies of the supernatural. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Agonizing Lethargy</h3>\n<p>You can use an action to expend a superiority die. When you do so, choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage for each attack it makes until the start of your next turn. A creature targeted by your Critical Analysis has disadvantage on the save.</p>\n<h3>Befogging Ichor</h3>\n<p>You can use a bonus action to expend a superiority die. When you do so, choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and on its turn must use its movement to move half its speed in a random direction. Roll a d8 and assign a direction to each face. If the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.</p>\n<h3>Chains of Transfixing</h3>\n<p>You can use a bonus action to expend a superiority die. When you do so, choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you that is no more than one size larger than you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or gain four levels of slowed until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Dark Transference</h3>\n<p>When you hit the target of your Critical Analysis with an attack, you can expend a superiority die and roll it to attempt to siphon life from it. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, add the result to the damage roll, and you regain one expended Hit Die.</p>\n<h3>Deathseek</h3>\n<p>When an attack made against the target of your Critical Analysis that you can see would miss, you can use a reaction to expend a superiority die and roll it to force the creature to instead take the hit. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes the minimum damage the attack could have dealt plus additional damage equal to the roll.</p>\n<h3>Reverse Curse</h3>\n<p>When another creature attempts to charm or frighten you or an ally you can see within 15 feet of you, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die and roll it to attempt to turn the effect back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be be charmed or frightened by you, dependent on the triggering ability, for a number of rounds equal to the die roll or until the creature takes any damage.</p>\n<h3>Shadow Puppetry</h3>\n<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die to give that creature a final act of aggression. That creature can immediately move a number of feet equal to 5 times the result of the die and make a single weapon attack against a target of your choice within its attack range, adding the die to the attack roll.</p>\n<h3>Water of Life</h3>\n<p>When an allied creature within 30 feet that you can see takes damage, you can use a reaction to expend a superiority die and roll it. The ally regains a number of hit points equal to the roll + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Wracking Torment</h3>\n<p>When a hostile creature you can see within 30 feet would take damage from an effect you or a friendly creature controls, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die to temporarily weaken their resilience against it. Until the end of the turn, the target loses resistance to the damage types of the triggering attack or power.</p>\n<h2>Heightened Hex</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Occultist Pursuit:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\n<p>When you use your Curse of Objurgation feature, each time the cursed creature deals damage to you or an allied creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the creature takes psychic damage equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2).</p>\n<h2>Voodoo Doll</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Occultist Pursuit:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p>Over the course of an hour, which can be done during a short rest, you can perform a ritual to construct an effigy of a creature. In order to do so, you must have at least heard of or seen the creature before, and the target must be in the same system as you. At the end of the hour, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. This saving throw is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it, as shown in the Knowledge Save Modifier and Connection Save Modifier tables below.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000000; text-transform: none;\">Knowledge Save Modifier</h3>\n<table style=\"border: 0; width: 300px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Secondhand (you have heard of the target)</td>\n<td align=\"right\">+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>firsthand (you have met the target</td>\n<td align=\"right\">+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Familiar (you know the target well)</td>\n<td align=\"right\">-5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 style=\"color: #000000; text-transform: none;\">Connection Save Modifier</h3>\n<table style=\"border: 0; width: 300px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Likeness or picture</td>\n<td align=\"right\">-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Curse of Objurgation</td>\n<td align=\"right\">-3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Possession or garment</td>\n<td align=\"right\">-4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like</td>\n<td align=\"right\">-10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this ritual against it again for 24 hours. On a failed save, the ritual creates a Tiny doll that is linked to the target. The doll remains linked for 24 hours, or for 10 minutes after you first use it. It disintegrates at the end of this duration. For the duration, you can see and hear the target through the doll as if you were within 5 feet of the creature.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as action while the doll is in your possession, you can expend a Hit Die to torment the target, choosing an effect from the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Burn:</strong> The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target believes it is burning. While burning in this way, the target has has disadvantage on attack rolls made with Strength or Dexterity. This effect lasts for 1 hour.</li>\n<li><strong>Pain:</strong> The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be wracked with pain for 1 hour. While in pain in this way, the target takes an additional 1d4 psychic damage whenever it takes damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Stab:</strong> The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or gain 2 slowed levels and fall prone. The slowed levels effect lasts for 1 hour.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The target can only be under 1 effect at a time. When you use a new effect, any existing effects end. Placing an effect on a target requires maintaining your concentration, as if concentrating on a power.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Toil and Trouble</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Occultist Pursuit:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You perfect your control of your curses, granting them unmatched potency. When the target of your Curse of Objurgation fails a saving throw against one of your maneuvers, you can choose to amplify that maneuver by expending a number of Hit Dice of your choice. The target immediately takes 1d8 psychic damage for every Hit Die spent in this way.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when creatures attempt to use a power like <em>remove curse</em> or other similar abilities to remove a curse you set, they must roll a Wisdom or Charisma check (their choice) against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, their attempt fails, and any force or tech points spent in this way are wasted.</p>\n<h2>Occultist Discoveries</h2>\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your research on the occult. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Arcane Membrane</h3>\n<p>You can add half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, rounded up, minimum of+1) to any Intelligence (Lore) or Intelligence (Nature) checks you make.</p>\n<h3>Evil Eye</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p>You can cast the <em>bestow curse</em> and <em>remove curse</em> force powers without spending force points. Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your forcecasting modifier for these powers.</p>\n<p>Once you've cast a power using this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can cast it again.</p>\n<h3>Exsanguination</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p>When a creature marked by your Curse of Objurgation is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use a reaction and expend a Hit Die to immediately regain a use of your Curse of Objurgation.</p>\n<h3>Hexes and Superstitions</h3>\n<p>When you roll a 13 on an ability check, you treat it as if you rolled a 20.</p>\n<h3>Natural Karma</h3>\n<p>Before you use a maneuver or power to set a curse on a target you can see, you can make a contested Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, the target is unaware you set the curse on them.</p>\n<h3>Savage Sortilege</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\n<p>You ignore resistance to psychic damage, and you have resistance to psychic damage.</p>\n<h3>Supernatural Vigor</h3>\n<p>At the end of a long rest, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet (this includes you) to imbue with unnatural power. The creature's hit point maximum and current hit points increase by an amount equal to your scholar level, and it has advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion. Both effects end after 8 hours.</p>"
