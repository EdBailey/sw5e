            "value": "<h1>Armormech Engineering</h1>\n<p>Those engineers who choose the Armormech Engineering discipline focus on the ability to work with hard metals and electronic shielding to construct and enhance all types of personal armor.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>When you choose this discipline at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in armormech's tools, medium armor, and heavy armor. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with armormech's tools, the rate at which you craft doubles.</p>\n<h2>Modified Armor</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to modify one unenhanced suit of armor or shield utilizing your armormech knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can expend materials equal to half the cost of the armor in order to modify it. You must have the armor, materials, and armormech's tools in order to perform this modification.</p>\n<p>Your modified armor is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified armor has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer class table. For each modification installed, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\n<p>Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.</p>\n<p>At 9th level, you can maintain both a modified suit of armor and shield. Each modified item has modification slots as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer class table.</p>\n<h2>Damage Absorption</h2>\n<p>Lastly at 3rd level, when you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to absorb some of that damage. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by the amount rolled on the die + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\n<h2>Extra Attack</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. You must be wearing your modified armor or wielding your modified shield to gain this benefit.</p>\n<h2>Astromech's Celerity</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, when you take the Attack action or use your action to a cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Suit Reliability</h2>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, your suit is like a second skin. Whenever you make an ability check or saving throw that uses Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. You must be wearing your modified armor to gain this benefit.</p>\n<h2>Armormech Modifications</h2>\n<p>If a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the modification at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.</p>\n<h3>Absorption Shield</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Physical Shield</em> <br />You modify your physical shield to block incoming damage. As a bonus action you can activate this ability and gain temporary hit points equal to 1d4 + Intelligence modifier, which last for one hour.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Accelerated Movement</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Armor</em> <br />You reduce the weight of your modified armor's bulk and increase the power to joints. If the armor has a Strength requirement, you ignore it. The modified armor's weight is reduced by 15 lbs. While wearing your modified armor your speed increases by 10 feet. This applies to all movement speeds you have while wearing your armor.</p>\n<h3>Adaptable Armor</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Armor</em> <br />You integrate deployable hooks and fins into your armor, augmenting its mobility. While wearing your modified armor, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. Additionally, you gain a swim speed equal to your walking speed.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Power Fist</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 11th level, Armor</em> <br /><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Prototype Power Fist</em> <br />You further modify your modified armor's gauntlet with increased reinforcement and weight. Your modified armor's unarmed strike deals 1d8 kinetic damage. Additionally, your unarmed strikes score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p>\n<h3>Artificially Intelligent</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level, Armor</em> <br />You install an artificial intelligence into your modified armor. While wearing your modified armor, when you make an ability check, your armor's artificial intelligence can take the Help action.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Bonded Plates</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em> <br />You gain a +1 bonus to AC against melee attacks. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.</p>\n<h3>Collapsible Suit</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level, Armor</em> <br />Your modified armor can collapse into a case for easy storage. When transformed this way the armor is indistinguishable from a normal case and weighs 1/3</p>\n<p>its normal weight. As an action you can don or doff the armor, allowing it to transform as needed.</p>\n<h3>Darkvision Visor</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Armor</em> <br />While wearing your modified armor, you have darkvision to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, this modification increases its range by 30 feet.</p>\n<h3>Enhanced Endurance</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Armor</em> <br />When you are reduced to 0 hit points while wearing your modified armor but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Electroshock Shield</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Shield Generator</em> <br />You install electroshockers in your shield generator. Whenever an enemy misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to do 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier lightning damage to the attacker.</p>\n<h3>Flight</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level, Armor</em> <br />You integrate a propulsion system into your modified armor. While wearing your modified armor you have an enhanced flying speed of 30 feet.</p>\n<h3>Grappling Harpoon</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Armor</em> <br />Your modified armor gains an integrated grappling harpoon set into your gauntlet. With this harpoon, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d6 kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.</p>\n<p>A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the harpoon. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the harpoon. Removing the harpoon requires a Strength check. While the harpoon is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.</p>\n<p>While the harpoon is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is larger than you. A creature or object your size or smaller is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover and reinsert the harpoon as an action.</p>\n<h3>Heavy Suit</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level, Armor</em> <br />You enhance your suit, making it difficult to move. As a bonus action, you can anchor your feet to the ground. While anchored, your speed is 0, you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>\n<h3>Infiltration Suit</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Armor</em> <br />You install a cloaking device in your modified armor. This device has 2 charges. As an action you can use 1 charge to cast @Compendium[sw5e.techpowers.Fb1sIhs7d6YWnF1J]{Infiltrate} targeting yourself.</p>\n<p>The cloaking device regains all expended charges after a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Magnetized Shield</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Physical Shield</em> <br />You modify your physical shield such that when a melee weapon attack misses you by an amount less than or equal to your bonus to AC from your shield, the attacking creature must make a Strength check against your tech save DC. On a failed save, the creature's weapon adheres to the shield. As an action, a creature can repeat this check. On a success, the weapon is freed.</p>\n<h3>Overload Shield</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Shield Generator</em> <br />You modify your shield generator to overload. As an action you can overload your shield. Each Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (their choice) against your tech save DC. On a failed save, they are pushed back 5 feet and knocked prone.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Power Fist</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Armor</em> <br />You modify your modified armor gauntlet with increased reinforcement and weight. Your modified armor's unarmed strike deals 1d4 kinetic damage.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you take the Attack action and make an unarmed attack, you can make an additional unarmed attack as a bonus action.</p>\n<h3>Prototype Power Fist</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level, Armor</em> <br /><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Power Fist</em> <br />You further modify your modified armor gauntlet with increased reinforcement and weight.

This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.</p>\n<h3>Resistance</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Armor</em> <br />You tune your modified armor against certain forms of damage. Choose acid, cold, fire, ion, lightning, or sonic damage. While wearing your modified armor you have resistance to that type of damage.</p>\n<p>You can select this modification multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different damage type.</p>\n<h3>Sealed Suit</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level, Armor</em> <br />As a bonus action you can hermetically seal your modified armor, giving you an air supply for up to 1 hour and making you immune to poison (but not curing you of existing poisoned conditions). Your armor regains 1 minute of air for every minute that you are not submerged and the armor is not sealed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, while you are wearing your modified armor you are considered adapted to cold and hot climates as well as high altitude, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.</p>\n<h3>Sentient Armor</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em> <br /><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Artificially Intelligent</em> <br />Your artificial intelligence has learned to control the suit without you being in it. It is now a valid target of the <em>tracker droid interface</em> tech power.</p>\n<p>While your armor is acting independently, it uses your ability scores, saving throws, and skills, and it has hit points equal to your engineer level. If reduced to 0 hit points, it falls directly to the ground, and it can not be equipped again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Shield Amplifier</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Shield Generator</em> <br />You modify your shield generator to project outward. As a bonus action you can amplify your shield until the start of your next turn. Each creature within 5 feet of you gains a bonus to AC equal to your shield's bonus.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Shield Anchor</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Physical Shield</em> <br />You modify your shield to be used as a portable source of cover. As an action, you can anchor or recover the shield. While anchored, you gain no benefit from a shield, and it does not require the use of a hand. Instead, while anchored, a light shield provides one-quarter cover, a medium shield provides half cover, and a large shield provides three-quarters cover.</p>\n<h3>Tech Blast</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Armor</em> <br />You modify your modified armor gauntlet to allow you to make a ranged tech attack. The weapon fires blasts of energy which deal 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier energy damage with a range of 30 feet. When you would make a ranged weapon attack, you can use this ranged tech attack in place of it.</p>\n<h3>Weapon Integration Armoring</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Armor</em> <br />You can integrate a single weapon that weighs no more than 8 lb. into your armor. While integrated, that weapon gains the hidden property. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength saving throws to avoid being disarmed.</p>"
