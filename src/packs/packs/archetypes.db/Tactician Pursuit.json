            "value": "<h1>Tactician Pursuit</h1>\n<p>Tacticians study strategy and the ways of war. Those scholars who choose the Tactician Pursuit train themselves and their allies in combat maneuvers to deftly eliminate their foes through clever positioning, and fierce, timely attacks.</p>\n<h2>Battle Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>When you choose this pursuit at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in martial blasters and martial vibroweapons.</p>\n<h2>Tactical Mastery</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to better command your allies to victory from afar. Your Critical Analysis range is increased to 90 feet.</p>\n<h2>Additional Maneuvers</h2>\n<p>Lastly at 3rd level, you gain access to new maneuvers which reflect your mastery in the field of combat. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Bolster</h3>\n<p>On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Commander's Strike</h3>\n<p>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature within 60 feet who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding your superiority die to the attack's damage roll.</p>\n<h3>Disarming Attack</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.</p>\n<h3>Distracting Strike</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3>Maneuvering Attack</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your allies into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you.</p>\n<p>That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.</p>\n<h3>Pushing Attack</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.</p>\n<h3>Riposte</h3>\n<p>When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.</p>\n<h3>Scholar's Parry</h3>\n<p>When a creature damages you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Targeted Attack</h3>\n<p>When you make a weapon attack roll, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.</p>\n<h3>Trip Attack</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.</p>\n<h2>Fire as One</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can focus your target down with the help with an ally. Once per round, whenever the creature that is the target of your Critical Analysis feature is attacked by someone other than you, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against them.</p>\n<h2>Battlefield Survey</h2>\n<p>Starting at 9th level, you become a master at leading your allies around in a battlefield you have studied. When you spend 10 minutes observing an area that is within 120 feet from you, or by using a detailed map, select a number of creatures up to your Intelligence modifier. You and those selected allies ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in that area.</p>\n<h2>All-Out Attack</h2>\n<p>Once you've reached 17th level, you can use your action to initiate an all-out attack. Choose a number of allies up to your Intelligence modifier within 60 feet who can see or hear you. The chosen allies may then immediately use their reaction to make one weapon attack against a target of your choice. You may choose the target for each attack separately.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Discoveries (Tactician)</h2>\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your mastery in the field of combat. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Commander's Armor</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\n<p>You gain proficiency in medium armor.</p>\n<h3>Contingency Plan</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>9th level</em></p>\n<p>When the target of your Critical Analysis feature scores a critical hit, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die to treat the attack as a normal hit instead.</p>\n<h3>Fighting Style</h3>\n<p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the Fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n<h3>Firing Command</h3>\n<p>As a bonus action, you can take the Help action. Additionally, when you take the Help action, it has a range of 30 feet.</p>\n<h3>Observant Leader</h3>\n<p>You can add your Intelligence modifier to any Wisdom (Perception) skill checks you make.</p>\n<h3>Studied Commander</h3>\n<p>When you make an Intelligence (Lore) or Intelligence (Technology) check related to battles, tactics, or weaponry, you may expend a superiority die and add it to the roll.</p>\n<h3>Tactical Retreat</h3>\n<p>When you take the Dash action, opportunity attacks made against you are made at disadvantage.</p>\n<h3>Unbound Commander</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 12th level</em></p>\n<p>You learn to command your allies to victory from afar. Your Critical Analysis range is increased to 120 feet.</p>"
