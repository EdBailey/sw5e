            "value": "<h1>Path of Witchcraft</h1>\n<p>The Force connects all living things. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Witchcraft use that connection to summon the aid of nature, both beasts and the elements, adapting them to their will.</p>\n<h2>Wild Power</h2>\n<p>Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the @Compendium[sw5e.forcepowers.L8CJ1QEXfKztMyCX]{Enfeeble} force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and the target fails its save. Finally, you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to damage rolls with it.</p>\n<h2>Beast Companion</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to create a powerful bond through the Force with your own personal beast companion.</p>\n<p>Choose your beast, which is detailed at the end of this calling. Over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can expend 500 cr worth of herbs and food to call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your companion.</p>\n<p>If your beast dies, or you want to bond with a different creature, you must first break the bond with your current beast companion. You may only have one beast companion at a time.</p>\n<p>Your beast gains a variety of benefits while it is bonded to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The beast obeys your commands as best it can. It acts on your turn, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your beast acts on its own.</li>\n<li>Your beast's level equals your sentinel level, and for each sentinel level you gain after 3rd, your beast companion gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.</li>\n<li>Your beast has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.</li>\n<li>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature in this class, your beast's abilities also improve. Your beast can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your beast can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, while your beast companion is within 5 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you use a Force-Empowered Self option to increase your speed or armor class, you can instead grant this bonus to your beast companion.</li>\n<li>You and your beast companion can communicate telepathically, though your beast companion can only communicate in and understand simple concepts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This radius increases to 10 feet at 7th level, 20 feet at 13th level, and 30 feet at 18th level.</p>\n<h2>Nature's Vigor</h2>\n<p>At 7th level, you've learned to attune your senses with nature. If you spend at least 1 minute meditating while in nature, you gain the following benefits for 1 hour:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You ignore difficult terrain caused by nature.</li>\n<li>You can understand plants within 30 feet of you. They can telepathically communicate simple ideas to you, including memories from within the past day.</li>\n<li>You can command plants within 30 feet of you to create difficult terrain, or other tasks at the GM's discretion (no action required).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2>Beastwarden</h2>\n<p>By 13th level, your bond with your beast companion strengthens, granting the following benefits while your beast companion is within 20 feet of you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you cast a force power that targets only yourself, and your beast companion is within range, you can also target your beast companion with that power.</li>\n<li>If you have darkvision and your beast doesn't, your beast gains it with the same radius. If your beast has darkvision and you don't, you gain it with the same radius. If you both have darkvision, you both use the larger radius, which then increases by 30 feet.</li>\n<li>If you have advantage on Perception checks and your beast doesn't, your beast gains advantage on Perception checks. If your beast has advantage on Perception checks and you don't, you gain advantage on Perception checks. If you both have advantage on Perception checks, when either of you makes a Perception check with advantage, you can reroll one of the dice once.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This radius increases to 30 feet at 18th level.</p>\n<h2>Stormcaller</h2>\n<p>At 18th level, you've learned to command the elements to summon a fierce storm in a 30-foot radius around you. As an action, you can gain the following benefits for 1 minute:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.</li>\n<li>You have resistance to energy, lightning, and necrotic damage.</li>\n<li>Whenever a hostile creature enters this radius or starts its turn there, it takes 10 lightning damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you use this feature, you can&rsquo;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Generating Your Beast</h2>\n<p>Choosing your beast companion is an integral part of being a Witchcraft Sentinel. Your beast takes a form of your choosing. Alternatively, your GM can choose what form your beast takes based on your environment.</p>\n<p>Once you've selected your type of beast, you assign your beast companion's ability scores. Your beast's Intelligence score is 6, and you assign its other ability scores using a limited standard array (16, 14, 14, 12, 10) as you see fit.</p>\n<h2>Beast Features</h2>\n<p>All beasts share the following traits.</p>\n<h3>Hit Points</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d4 per beast companion level</li>\n<li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 4 + your beast's Constitution modifier</li>\n<li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d4 (or 3) + your beast's Constitution modifier per beast level after 1st</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Proficiencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Your beast can understand simple commands spoken in two languages of your choice, as well as hand signals, but it can not speak</li>\n<li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Choose one from Strength, Intelligence, or Charisma, and another from Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom</li>\n<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, Intimidation, Perception, Performance, Survival, and Stealth</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Armor Class:</strong> 10 + your beast's Dexterity modifier</li>\n<li><strong>Bestial Traits:</strong> Your beast companion has four bestial traits of your choice.
