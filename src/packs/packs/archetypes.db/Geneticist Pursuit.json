Those scholars who choose the Geneticist Pursuit put their knowledge into practice, splicing their own genetic material to become superior beings... or monsters.</p>\n<h2>Genesplicer's Methods</h2>\n<p>When you choose this pursuit at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with geneticist's kit and your choice of Medicine or Survival skills.</p>\n<h2>Mutagenic Analysis</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, while you are the target of your Critical Analysis feature, you can add half your Intelligence modifier (rounded down, minimum of one) to any saving throw you make that doesn't already include that modifier.</p>\n<h2>Additional Maneuvers</h2>\n<p>Lastly at 3rd level, you gain access to new maneuvers which reflect the changes your body has undergone. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Acid Burst</h3>\n<p>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a sudden and violent expulsion of acidic fluid. You expend a superiority die, and cause all creatures within a 15-foot cone to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take damage equal to the number rolled on your superiority die plus your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Charging Attack</h3>\n<p>If you move at least 10 feet towards your target before successfully hitting them with a melee attack, you may expend a superiority die, causing the target to take additional damage equal to the result, and forcing it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save the creature is knocked prone.</p>\n<h3>Electrical Discharge</h3>\n<p>When you succeed on a check to initiate or maintain a grapple, you can expend a superiority die. The creature takes lightning damage equal to the amount rolled on the die.</p>\n<h3>Rampage</h3>\n<p>When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can use your bonus action to expend a superiority die and move up to half your speed.

On a failed save, it takes poison damage equal to the result of the die and is poisoned until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h2>Mutagenic Transformation</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, when you target yourself with your Critical Analysis feature, you can choose to undergo a mutagenic transformation. Your form shifts, exaggerating and strengthening your geneticist discoveries for 1 hour. You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</li>\n<li>Your Strength score becomes equal to your Intelligence score.</li>\n<li>You gain a bonus to your AC equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded down, minimum of +1) if it doesn't already include that modifier.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can end this effect early on your turn as a bonus action. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Geneticist's Resilience</h2>\n<p>Starting at 9th level, your genetic alterations make you immune to poison and disease. Additionally, you have resistance to poison damage.</p>\n<h2>Chimeric Adaptation</h2>\n<p>Once you've reached 17th level, your genetic modifications have reached new heights. When you complete a short or long rest, you can choose one of the following features. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you also gain the benefits of the chosen feature for the duration. You can only have one of these features at a time.</p>\n<h3>Aspect of the Terentatek</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma saving throws. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against force powers, and when a creature within 30 feet of you casts a force power, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards the creature. You must end this movement closer to the creature than you started. If you end this movement within 5 feet of the creature, you can make one melee attack against the creature (no action required).</p>\n<h3>Aspect of the Rancor</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency in Strength and Constitution saving throws. Additionally, you gain immunity to the frightened condition, and when you deal damage with a weapon or unarmed strike, you can deal an additional 1d8 damage of the same type as the weapon's damage.</p>\n<h3>Aspect of the Varactyl</h3>\n<p>You gain proficiency in Dexterity and Intelligence saving throws. Additionally, your speed increases by 10 feet, you ignore effects that would reduce your speed, your attack rolls can't suffer from disadvantage, and creatures can't have advantage on attack rolls against you.</p>\n<h2>Discoveries (Geneticist)</h2>\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect the changes you have caused your own body to undergo. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Adapted Hide</h3>\n<p>When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, you are adapted to hot or cold climates (your choice), as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you add your full Intelligence modifier, instead of half, to your AC for the duration.</p>\n<h3>Atmospheric Adaptation</h3>\n<p>You can breathe air and water. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you no longer need to breathe, and you can survive up to one hour within the vacuum of space for the duration.</p>\n<h3>Enhanced Musculature</h3>\n<p>You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or</p>\n<p>lift. Additionally, when you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Strength score. When you make a high jump, you can leap a number of feet up into the air equal to 3 + twice your Strength modifier. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws for the duration.</p>\n<h3>Icarian Mutation</h3>\n<p>You sprout a pair of winged arms. You gain a flight speed equal to half your walking speed. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required). When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, your flying speed increases to your full walking speed, and you can use your bonus action to take the Dash action for the duration.</p>\n<h3>Mutagenic Hardiness</h3>\n<p>Your hit point maximum increases by a number equal to your level, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, and at the beginning of each of your turns, you gain temporary hit points equal to your half your scholar level (rounded down) + your Intelligence modifier for the duration.</p>\n<h3>Predatory Senses</h3>\n<p>You have darkvision out to 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range instead increases by 30 feet. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell for the duration. Additionally, you can track creatures that have left a scent in the last 24 hours.</p>\n<h3>Underground Adaptation</h3>\n<p>You gain a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed and you can tunnel through solid rock at a rate of 1 foot per round. In order to use this speed, you must have two free hands. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you gain tremorsense out to 30 feet for the duration. You can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures.</p>\n<h3>Unnatural Weaponry</h3>\n<p>You sprout claws or some other natural weapon, which deal 1d4 kinetic damage on a hit. You can use your choice of your Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, your unarmed strikes increase to a d6 and are considered enhanced for the duration. Additionally, you deal an additional 1d4 acid, lightning, or poison damage when you hit with them.</p>"
