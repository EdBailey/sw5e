            "value": "<h1>Kro Var Order</h1>\n<p>Monks of the Kro Var Order&mdash;known as shapers&mdash;utilize a unique power to bend the four elements to their will, creating effects as small as a floating flame to quakes that sunder the earth.</p>\n<h2>Elemental Attunement</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Kro Var Order:</strong> 3rd, 11th, and 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You gain the ability to bend the elements to your will. As an action, you can manipulate these forces to create one of the following effects of your choice at a space within 10 feet of you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect related to air, earth, fire, or water, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, a spray of light mist, or a gentle rumbling of stone.</li>\n<li>Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.</li>\n<li>Chill or warm up to 1 pound of nonliving material for up to 1 hour.</li>\n<li>Cause earth, fire, water, or mist that can fit within a 1 foot cube to shape itself into a crude form you designate for 1 minute.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This range increases to 30 feet at 11th level and 60 feet at 17th level.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as a bonus action on your turn, you can spend 1 focus point to conjure a weapon made of one of the four elements&mdash;air, earth, fire, or water&mdash;which lasts for 1 minute. Your weapon takes an appearance of your choice, it can only be used by you, and you can't be disarmed of it while you are conscious. You are proficient in this weapon, which counts as a monk weapon for you and uses your Martial Arts die for its damage rolls. You can only have one of these weapons at a time, and if you summon a new one the old one immediately disappears.</p>\n<h3>Air</h3>\n<p>Your whistling weapon has the thrown property with a range of 20/60 and deals sonic damage on a hit. Additionally, when you hit a creature with the weapon, it is deafened until the end of its next turn.</p>\n<h3>Earth</h3>\n<p>Your earthen weapon takes the form of stone and deals kinetic damage on a hit. Additionally, when you hit a creature with it, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed back 5 feet. Lastly, while active, you can use Strength instead of Dexterity when determining your AC, as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.</p>\n<h3>Fire</h3>\n<p>Your flaming weapon sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, deals fire damage, and when you hit a creature with it, the creature takes additional damage equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, rounded up, minimum of one).</p>\n<h3>Water</h3>\n<p>Your watery weapon has the reach property, deals cold damage on a hit, and you can use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) instead of Dexterity or Strength for its attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Additionally, when you would make a melee weapon attack, you can instead use your weapon to wet a 5-foot square within your weapon's reach. The affected area is difficult terrain. Each creature who starts its turn in the square or enters it for the first time must make a Dexterity saving throw, falling prone on a failed save.</p>\n<h2>Elemental Adept</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Kro Var Order:</strong> 6th, 11th, and 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You gain two of the following features. You gain an additional option at 11th and 17th level.</p>\n<p>You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<p>While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 2 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 2 until you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Burning Ember Flourish</h3>\n<p>You can use your action to choose an area of flame that you can see and that fits within a 5-foot cube within 60 feet. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Fireworks.</strong></em> The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Smoke.</strong></em> Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.</p>\n<h3>Curtain of Unyielding Wind</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can spend 2 focus points to call up a mighty gale, which swirls around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for 10 minutes. The wind deafens both you and other creatures in its area. It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller and hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind. The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you, and the attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the attacks pass in or out of the wind.</p>\n<h3>Crushing Hand of the Mountain</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 30 feet. A Medium hand made from soil and stone, which lasts for 1 minute, rises in that space and reaches for one Large or smaller creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 kinetic damage and is restrained for the duration. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 kinetic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. To break out, the restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your focus save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand. As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.</p>\n<h3>Hatchling's Flame</h3>\n<p>As an action, you focus your energy into a torrent of fire that streaks away from you. A line of roaring flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<h3>Patient Bantha Listens</h3>\n<p>You reach out to the ground beneath you. You can use your bonus action to gain tremorsense with a range of 30 feet and a burrow speed equal to your walking speed for up to 1 minute. Your movement leaves behind a tunnel that remains for as long as this ability is active, after which it collapses.</p>\n<h3>Rush of the Shyrack</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can spend 2 focus points to form a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide that blasts from you in a direction you choose for one minute or until you lose concentration or dismiss the effect (no action required). Each Large or smaller creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line. Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you. The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them. As a bonus action on each of your turns before the effect ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.</p>\n<h3>Shape the Raincloud</h3>\n<p>You can use your action to pull water from air and return it to the atmosphere. In an open container, you can create up to 20 gallons of drinkable water. You may also produce a rain that falls within a 30-foot cube and extinguishes open-air flames. You can destroy the same amount of water in an open container, or destroy a 30-foot cube of fog.</p>\n<h3>Swarming Ice Rabbit</h3>\n<p>As an action, you can cause a flurry of ice crystals to erupt from a point you can see within 90 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 cold damage and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't slowed.</p>\n<h2>Elemental Master</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Kro Var Order:</strong> 11th and 17th level</em></p>\n<p>At 11th level, you gain one of the following features. You gain an additional option at 17th level.</p>\n<p>You can use these features a combined number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\n<p>While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 3 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 3 until you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Earth Reaches for Sky</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Crushing Hand of the Mountain or Patient Bantha Listens</em></p>\n<p>As an action, you can choose a point you can see on the ground within 120 feet. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.</p>\n<h3>Ride the Wind</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Curtain of Unyielding Wind or Rush of the Shyrack</em></p>\n<p>As an action, you can gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed for 10 minutes. You can hover while this technique is active, but when it ends, you fall if you are still aloft, unless you can stop the fall.</p>\n<h3>River of Hungry Flame</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Burning Ember Flourish or Hatchling's Flame</em></p>\n<p>As an action, you can create a wall of fire on a solid surface within 120 feet. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>\n<p>One side of the wall, chosen by you when you use this feature, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side of the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.</p>\n<h3>Shape the Flowing River</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Shape the Raincloud or Swarming Ice Rabbit</em></p>\n<p>As an action, you can control any freestanding water within 300 feet of you inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you use this feature. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; <em><strong>Flood.</strong></em> You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller creatures struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of being knocked prone. The water level remains elevated until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Part Water.</strong></em> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the feature's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong></em> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the feature's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues co move in the direction you chose until the feature ends or you choose a different effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Whirlpool.</strong></em> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your feature save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 kinetic damage and is caught in the vortex until the feature ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 kinetic damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p>\n<h2>Elemental Paragon</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Kro Var Order:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\n<p>You gain one of the following features.</p>\n<p>Once you've used the chosen feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<p>While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 4 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 4 until you complete a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Archetype of Air</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Ride the Wind</em></p>\n<p>As an action, you conjure a whirlwind around you, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ranged attacks made against you have disadvantage.</li>\n<li>You gain a flying speed of 60 feet. If you are still flying when the technique ends, you fall, unless you can somehow prevent it.</li>\n<li>You can use your action to create a 15 foot cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a Large or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.</p>\n<h3>Figure of Flame</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> River of Hungry Flame</em></p>\n<p>As an action, you cause flames to race across your body, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have resistance to fire damage.</li>\n<li>The flames shed bright light in a 30 foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.</li>\n<li>Any creature that moves within 5 feet of you for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes 1d10 fire damage.</li>\n<li>You can use your action to create a line of fire 15 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.</p>\n<h3>Icon of Ice</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Shape the Flowing River</em></p>\n<p>As an action, you cause frost to chill the area around you, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have resistance to cold damage.</li>\n<li>You can move across difficult terrain created by ice or snow without spending extra movement.</li>\n<li>The ground in a 10 foot radius around you is icy and is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. The radius moves with you.</li>\n<li>You can use your action to create a 15 foot cone of freezing ice extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.</p>\n<h3>Embodiment of Earth</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Earth Reaches for Sky</em></p>\n<p>As an action, you cause rock to envelop you, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage.</li>\n<li>You can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone without spending extra movement. You can move through solid earth or stone as if it were air without destabilizing it, but you can't end your movement there. If you do so, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.</li>\n<li>You can use your action to create a small earthquake on the ground in a 15 foot radius centered on you. Other creatures on that ground must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.</p>\n<h2>Avatar</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Kro Var Order:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\n<p>As an ultimate display of your mastery of the elements, you can spend 5 focus points as an action to have the elements of water, earth, fire, and air form a protective sphere around your body, gaining multiple benefits for 1 minute. While this ability is active, you have resistance to cold, energy, fire, kinetic, lightning, and sonic damage. You also gain a burrow, fly, and swim speed equal to your movement speed. Lastly, you can use any of the following abilities as a bonus action:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You create a small earthquake on the ground in a 15 foot radius around you. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1 d6 kinetic damage and is knocked prone.</li>\n<li>You create a line of fire 15 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from you in a direction you choose.
