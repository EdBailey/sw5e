            "value": "<h1>Slicer Pursuit</h1>\n<p>Across the galaxy one can find numerous pseudonyms and false identities belonging to the hackers and cyber-infiltrators that call the world of electronics home. Those scholars who choose the Slicer Pursuit put their impressive intellectual prowess to work in the field of technology, to ends both benevolent and malicious.</p>\n<h2>Techcasting</h2>\n<p>When you choose this pursuit at 3rd level, you have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.</p>\n<h3>Tech Powers Known</h3>\n<p>You learn 4 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Slicer Pursuit Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.</p>\n<h3>Tech Points</h3>\n<p>You have a number of tech points equal to half of your scholar level (rounded up), as shown in the Tech Points column of the Slicer Pursuit Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h3>Max Power Level</h3>\n<p>Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Slicer Pursuit Techcasting table.</p>\n<p>You may only cast tech powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Techcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Tech save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Tech attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h3>Techcasting Focus</h3>\n<p>You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) as a techcasting focus for your tech powers.</p>\n<div class=\"classtable\">\n<blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: #000000; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: 'Russo One'; background-color: #bdc8cc; font-size: 16px;\" colspan=\"6\"><em>Slicer Pursuit Techcasting</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\">Level</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Tech Powers Known</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Tech Points</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Max Power Level</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">3rd</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">4th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">5th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">6th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">6</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">7th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">7</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">8th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">8</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">9th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">9</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">10th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">10</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">11th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">11</td>\n<td align=\"center\">6</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">12th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">12</td>\n<td align=\"center\">6</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">13th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">13</td>\n<td align=\"center\">7</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">14th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">14</td>\n<td align=\"center\">7</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">15th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">15</td>\n<td align=\"center\">8</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">16th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">16</td>\n<td align=\"center\">8</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">17th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">17</td>\n<td align=\"center\">9</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">18th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">18</td>\n<td align=\"center\">9</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">19th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">19</td>\n<td align=\"center\">10</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">20th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">20</td>\n<td align=\"center\">10</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<h2>Systems Hijack</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, when the target of your Critical Analysis is a droid or construct, or wearing or holding a techcasting focus, that creature is a viable target for any tech powers with you cast with a range of touch.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when the target of your Critical Analysis casts a tech power, you can use your reaction to identify the tech power being cast, and at what level.</p>\n<h2>Additional Maneuvers</h2>\n<p>Lastly at 3rd level, you gain access to new maneuvers which reflect your understanding of tech casting. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Automatic Startup Sequence</h3>\n<p>When a creature makes a saving throw against a tech power you cast, you may expend a superiority die, subtracting the number rolled from their total. You can use this maneuver before or after the creature makes saving throw, but before the GM determines whether or not the creature fails.</p>\n<h3>Fast Access Programs</h3>\n<p>When you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher that has a casting time of 1 action, you can expend a superiority die to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</p>\n<h3>Firewall</h3>\n<p>When you or an ally you can see within 60 feet make a saving throw against a tech power, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die, adding the number rolled to the result of that saving throw.</p>\n<h3>Hacked Communications</h3>\n<p>As an action, you may expend a superiority die, and choose any number of creatures that you can see within 60 feet of you that have commlinks, headcomms, or other such communications devices. Each creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take sonic damage equal to the number rolled on the dice + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). Additionally, on a failed save, their communication devices are disabled until rebooted.</p>\n<h3>Overcapacity Powers</h3>\n<p>When you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher, you may expend a superiority die to cast the power at a higher level, provided is does not exceed your Maximum Power Level. Roll the superiority die, and add it to the level at which you are casting the power. You can choose to cast it at this new power level or lower.</p>\n<h3>Runtime Extension</h3>\n<p>When a tech power you cast with a duration of 1 minute or longer reaches the end of its duration, you may expend a superiority die to extend the duration of the power a number of rounds equal to the number rolled on your superiority die.</p>\n<h3>Subtle Execution</h3>\n<p>When you cast a tech power, you may expend a superiority die to cast the power without any visual or auditory cues. Creatures have disadvantage on any Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) checks made to determine if you were the caster.</p>\n<h2>Potent Programming</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, when a creature succeeds on a saving throw against an at-will tech power you cast that deals damage, the creature takes half the power's damage, but suffers no additional effects of the power.</p>\n<h2>Redirect Error</h2>\n<p>Starting at 9th level, when the target of your Critical Analysis feature casts a tech power that affects an area, you can use your reaction to cause that power to instead affect an area in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the caster.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2>System Override</h2>\n<p>Once you've reached 17th level, you know how to quickly activate anti-tech subroutines you have encoded into your wristpad. You can cast the @Compendium[sw5e.techpowers.g0WJVphRgr0iSG1x]{Diminish Tech} and @Compendium[sw5e.techpowers.9Vg5TEwWdVh3NVym]{Tech Override} powers at 3rd level without expending tech points. If the target is the target of your Critical Analysis, you have advantage on the techcasting ability check for these powers.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of time equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded down, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h2>Discoveries (Slicer)</h2>\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your understanding of tech casting. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<h3>Administrator's Log</h3>\n<p>If you spend at least 10 minutes working on a computer or terminal, you can get a full list of users who have accessed the machine within the past 24 hours. Over the course of a long rest, you may then form a facsimile of identification that would allow you to pass yourself off as that person when accessing machines.</p>\n<h3>Backdoor Egress</h3>\n<p>When you cast a tech power that affects an area and requires a saving throw, and you are inside that power's area, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If you end this movement outside the area affected by the tech power, you do not have to make a saving throw to avoid its effects.</p>\n<h3>Intelligence Core Override</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\n<p>You can cast the @Compendium[sw5e.techpowers.NagD6z90jRyd7zOk]{Override Interface} tech power at 5th level without spending tech points.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Resource Appropriation</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 11th level</em></p>\n<p>If you reduce the target of your Critical Analysis feature to 0 hit points, and it has tech point remaining, you may choose to gain any tech points it had remaining. Your current tech points cannot exceed your tech point maximum.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h3>Skillful Casting</h3>\n<p>When you hit a creature with an at-will tech power that requires an attack roll, you may treat that attack roll as a weapon attack for the purpose of using maneuvers.</p>\n<h3>Sleeper Program</h3>\n<p>Whenever you cast a tech power with a casting time of 1 action, you can choose to delay the power's activation up to a minute. When you do so, you cast the power as normal, but holds its energy for the duration of the delay. Holding onto the power's effect requires concentration. If your concentration is broken before the delay ends, the power dissipates without taking effect. You can use your reaction to activate the power at any time.</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>"
