They tap into these powers to cloud the minds of their foes, distracting and diverting before abruptly dispatching them.</p>\n<h2>Forcecasting</h2>\n<p>When you choose this practice at 3rd level, you have derived powers from your emotional connection to the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.</p>\n<h3>Force Powers Known</h3>\n<p>You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.</p>\n<h3>Force Points</h3>\n<p>You have a number of force points equal to your operative level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Max Power Level</h3>\n<p>Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table.</p>\n<p>You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\n<h3>Forcecasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. In addition, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Force save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +your forcecasting ability modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Force attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus +your forcecasting ability modifier</p>\n<div class=\"classtable\">\n<blockquote>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: #000000; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: 'Russo One'; background-color: #bdc8cc; font-size: 16px;\" colspan=\"6\"><em>Beguiler Practice Forcecasting</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\">Level</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Force Powers Known</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Force Points</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Max Power Level</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">3rd</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">4th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">6</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">5th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">7</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">6th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">8</td>\n<td align=\"center\">6</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">7th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">10</td>\n<td align=\"center\">7</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">8th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">11</td>\n<td align=\"center\">8</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">9th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">12</td>\n<td align=\"center\">9</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">10th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">13</td>\n<td align=\"center\">10</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">11th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">14</td>\n<td align=\"center\">11</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">12th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">15</td>\n<td align=\"center\">12</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2nd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">13th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">17</td>\n<td align=\"center\">13</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">14th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">18</td>\n<td align=\"center\">14</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">15th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">19</td>\n<td align=\"center\">15</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">16th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">20</td>\n<td align=\"center\">16</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">17th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">22</td>\n<td align=\"center\">17</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">18th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">23</td>\n<td align=\"center\">18</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">19th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">24</td>\n<td align=\"center\">19</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"rows\">\n<td align=\"center\">20th</td>\n<td align=\"center\">25</td>\n<td align=\"center\">20</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<h2>Fascinating Display</h2>\n<p>Also at 3rd level, you can spend 1 minute attemping to distract and enthrall those around you. Choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched your display for the duration, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, speaking glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it. Additionally, it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.</p>\n<p>If a target succeeds on this saving throw, the target has no hint you tried to charm it.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\n<h2>Mesmerizing Presence</h2>\n<p>Beginning at 9th level, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures charmed by you.</p>\n<h2>Enthralling Vigor</h2>\n<p>Starting at 13th level, whenever a creature fails a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw against a force power or class feature you use, you can gain temporary hit points equal to half your operative level (rounded down) + your Charisma modifier (minimum of one).</p>\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<h2>Distracting Countenance</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, as a bonus action, you can mask yourself with the Force for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your powers on your next turn.</p>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must com-plete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>"
