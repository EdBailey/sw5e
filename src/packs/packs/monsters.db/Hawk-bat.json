Both were feared and admired, although they were considered an elegant species. To get on a hawk-bat's bad side could be very dangerous. As a result, very few lived in captivity.</p><p>Because of this, they became a symbol for many swoop gangs and pirates. The lightsaber form Ataru was named after the hawk-bat. One of the battalions which fought under the 101st Regiment during the Clone Wars was also known as the Hawkbat Battalion.</p><p>The wingspan of a hawk-bat averaged 1.5 meters. The wings consisted of a thin membrane stretched over a series of wing-bones. The membrane itself was studded with spiky growths. The hooked beak of a hawk-bat contained tiny teeth that could tear prey to shreds, which they found with a combination of accurate eyesight and echolocation.</p><p>Flocks of hawk-bats would hunt and attack their prey as if they were one. Though they favored granite slugs and shadowmoth larvae, hawk-bats would feed on anything that moved. Even large enemies could be taken down by a large flock of hawk-bats. Though a solitary hawk-bat could prove to be a significant threat, it was weaker when it was alone.</p><p>If one hawk-bat was disturbed, all of its companions would attack the aggravator at once. They usually traveled in large flocks through the pipes and lower levels of Coruscant. Every few months, they migrated despite lack of seasons within the lower levels. Because of this, many scientists came to believe that hawk-bats evolved during the ancient times of Coruscant, making them the only known species to survive Coruscant's urbanization. Hawk-bats hated the cold and usually stayed away from it. Many lived on power cables or in heated vents, hanging upside down from warm pipes below buildings.</p><p>Like other avian species, the young of hawk-bats hatched from eggs. They lacked the feathers exant in most avian species, but were covered in leathery scaled skin normally found in reptiles and were thus actually reptavians. To keep their young safe during this critical period, hawk-bats would camouflage the brown and green eggs as best they could to make them appear to be mere rocks. And though the eggs may have looked abandoned by their parents, it was certain that one of them\u2014most likely the mother\u2014was keeping eye on the nest from a distance.</p><p>Hawk-bat mothers were extremely protective of their young. Any predator who saw through the camouflage and threatened the eggs would quickly learn the full fury of a hawk-bat mother's wrath.</p><p>When they hatched from their eggs, young hawk-bats had green skin and were fully independent. Upon reaching maturity, the hawk-bat would shed its green skin and emerge with purplish-gray skin.</p><h3>Hawk-bat as delicacy</h3><p>Sometime before or during the Imperial Period, Ortolan chef Handree Braman discovered that hawk-bat flesh was edible. He recommended cooking it at 1,000 degrees for no more than twenty minutes.</p><p>Many beings found hawk-bat meat delicious, and hawk-bat eggs were considered a delicacy. Emperor Palpatine had a private aviary of hawk-bats in the Imperial Palace on Coruscant, where he and guests could have hawk-bats at their leisure.</p><p>Hawk-bats managed to survive the Yuuzhan Vong War, and seem to have adapted to Coruscant's newly introduced biological components.</p>",
