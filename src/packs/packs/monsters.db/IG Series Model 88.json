Therefore, we will remain.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">- IG-88</span></p></blockquote><p>IG-88, also known as IG-88B, or as a Phlutdroid, was a rogue, deadly masculine IG-series assassin droid manufactured by Holowan Laboratories who worked as a bounty hunter. Following the Battle of Hoth, he and several other bounty hunters were summoned by Darth Vader to the Executor and hired to track down the Millennium Falcon and her Rebel crew. Unable to track his quarry, IG-88 trailed his chief rival, Boba Fett, to Bespin, where the bounty hunter nearly destroyed the assassin droid, however IG-88 managed to survive. At some point IG-88 undertook a software infiltration into Death Star II, but his plan was single-handedly thwarted by R2-Q5. The droid later met with mercenary Bazine Netal to speak about the location of the Millennium Falcon.</p><h3>Biography</h3><p><b>Origins</b></p><p>The first of the IG-series assassin droid models created in secret by Holowan Laboratories. IG-88[10] also known as IG-88B or as a Phlutdroid, realized his skill and desire to kill the moment he was first activated and turned on his creators, killing everyone in the lab. From that moment on, he became one of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy, in part due to the lingering fear of droids, particularly those capable of battle and assassination, from the Clone Wars gaining notoriety comparable only to that of Boba Fett, his chief rival.</p><p><b>Age of the Empire</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"You're certain this is where we'll find the individuals involved in the rebel activity on Savareen? I don't like being disappointed, bounty hunter.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 13px\"><i>\"Yes. I am certain.\"</i></span></p><p>- Kallus and IG-88</p></blockquote><p>During the Age of the Empire, IG-88 was hired by Imperial Security Bureau Agent Alexsandr Kallus to assist in tracking down Imperial Army deserter turned smuggler, Captain Han Solo of the Millennium Falcon.</p><p><b>Capturing Qi'ra</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"Oh, Qi'ra, Qi'ra. It does look like you have fallen into our little trap. Catching you was quite difficult, my young friend. I had to partner with IG-88 here.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 13px\"><i>\"A Crimson Dawn Lieutenant will fetch a nice bounty.\"</i></span></p><p>- Hondo Ohnaka and IG-88</p></blockquote><p>Later, IG-88 teamed up with Hondo Ohnaka to collect the bounty on Crimson Dawn lieutenant Qi'ra's head. Tracking Qi'ra down, IG-88 and Hondo managed to apprehend Qi'ra. Turning the bounty hunter and the pirate against each other, Qi'ra convinced IG-88 to collect the bounty on Hondo instead of the bounty on her. Attacking Hondo, IG-88 was quickly stunned and put in binders. After Qi'ra had similarly tricked and apprehended Hondo, IG-88 was led away by Qi'ra so that she could collect the bounty on his head.<br></p><p><b>Seeking a data-tape<br></b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"What is that?\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 13px\"><i>\"IG-88. An actual bounty hunter. Also, probably interested in your data tape. He's good\u2014one of the best in the galaxy. And he's a surprise. Take cover!\"</i></span></p><p>- Leia Organa and Sabine Wren</p></blockquote><p>Later, IG-88 pursued Princess Leia Organa on Garel, seeking a data-tape in her possession of Imperial base locations. Organa was assisted by Sabine Wren, who identified the droid, and the pair fled as the assassin opened fire in the corridors of Garel City Spaceport. However, Wren planted a paint bomb, surprising IG-88 and covering him in purple paint. Leia convinced several stormtroopers to fire at the bounty hunter, and the droid was hit by a blast before retreating.</p><p><b>Apprehending a thief</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"To kill is reward enough.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">- IG-88, to the Imperial captain</span></p></blockquote><p>IG-88 was hired by an Imperial captain to capture a thief named Venga Liss who hijacked a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle on a jungle planet. Eventually IG-88 killed Liss when he detonated the shuttle.</p><p><b>Capturing the Gatto Gang</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"IG-88! This deadly droid had been given the task of capturing the sneaky Gatto Gang.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">- CR-8R</span></p></blockquote><p>IG-88 was hired by Duke Blazor of the Black Sun to capture the Gatto Gang that consisted of Sylvestarr, Ziggee and Moggee. He later eventually captured all three of them.</p><p><b>Hired by Vader</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"There will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">- Darth Vader to IG-88 and several other bounty hunters</span></p></blockquote><p>By the year 0 ABY, IG-88 consorted with the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure. He was present in the Hutt's palace while Jabba received Darth Vader. The Sith Lord told the Hutt to dispense with his audience, and IG-88, along with fellow hunters including Fett and 4-LOM, departed from the court. In 3 ABY, IG-88 answered a call put out by Vader for bounty hunters to track down the Millennium Falcon. He and several other hunters, including Boba Fett, assembled aboard the Executor, where Vader offered a bounty for the live capture of Han Solo and his companions. IG-88 tailed the Millenium Falcon along with Fett to Cloud City on the planet Bespin, where the assassin droid was defeated and left for scrap after his longtime rival caught it trailing him. Ultimately, Darth Vader captured Solo for Boba Fett who then delivered the bounty to Jabba on Tatooine.</p><p><b>Infiltrating the Death Star II</b></p><p>At some point before or during 4 ABY, IG-88 undertook a software infiltration of the Empire's second Death Star. However, his plan was single-handedly thwarted by the Imperial astromech droid R2-Q5.</p><p>Around 9 ABY, another IG-series assassin droid, IG-11, was an active bounty hunter and was often mistaken for IG-88.</p><p><b>Contacted by Bazine Netal</b></p><blockquote><p><i>\"...We would have apprehended the Millennium Falcon.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 13px\"><i>\"But you didn't.\"</i></span></p><p><i>\"Correct.\"</i></p><p>- IG-88 and Bazine Netal about the time when he nearly captured the Falcon with Kallus</p></blockquote><p>In 34 ABY, at some point after the Battle of Takodana, IG-88 was contacted by the mercenary Bazine Netal to discuss the location of the Millennium Falcon after she heard a rumor about the time IG-88 nearly caught the Falcon. During their rendezvous, IG-88 took the opportunity to tell Netal when he almost caught the Falcon with Kallus. IG-88 told Netal that he almost caught the Millennium Falcon again, but lost out to Fett. Netal responded that, though he had a lot of excuses, her employer only paid for results. She informed IG-88 that someone knew where the Falcon was and that they would tell her where it was before leaving him to continue with her search.<br></p><h3>Characteristics</h3><blockquote><p><i>\"This notorious IG-series assassin droid possessed an unstoppable desire to hunt and kill his prey, earning him a reputation as one of the top five bounty hunters in the galaxy. It also earned him access to some of the best-paying clients, like Darth Vader and a wide variety of Hutts.</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">- R0-GR</span></p></blockquote><p>A rogue class 4 assassin droid, IG-88 was obsessed with hunting, destroying, and killing as a result of his incompletely formed droid programming. He tended to hunt alone and earned a reputation as a merciless hunter.</p><p>A hideous, battered chrome war droid, IG-88 stood 1.96 meters in height. His steady aim, along with his ability to track targets with advanced sensors that ringed his head and allowed him to see in all directions, won him great success. These sensors included multiple red photoreceptors, a heat sensor, and a sound sensor. IG-88 also had a vocoder at the base of his head. His torso was able to fully rotate on the battlefield, allowing him to blast enemies on all sides. His tough metal body allowed him to survive most attacks without taking any damage and featured acid-proof servo wires.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><blockquote><p><i>\"IG-88 could take down almost any target with his signature sniper rifle\u2026 as long as Boba Fett didn't get there first.\"</i></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">- R0-GR</span></p></blockquote><p>IG-88 carried an arsenal of weapons, including blaster rifles, pulse cannons, a DAS-430 Neural Inhibitor, and a needle dart gun that launched poison darts. However, his most dangerous weapons were hidden inside his slender frame, including a flamethrower, a sonic device, and toxic gas dispensers. IG-88 also wore an ammunition bandolier that carried his concussion discs and vibroblades. As an IG-series droid, he was designed to have blasters built into each arm, but they were never installed. IG-88 owned a modified Aggressor assault fighter called the IG-2000.</p>",
