You can only use this feature once per round.</p><p>Additionally, you regain all expended uses of your System Disruption feature when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>Lastly, when you would make an Interfere, Scan, or Probe check while deployed as an operator, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you\u2019ve used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>"
