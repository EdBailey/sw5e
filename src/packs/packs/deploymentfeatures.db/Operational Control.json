You can use only one disruption per turn, and you can only use each disruption once per round.</p><p>You learn an additional disruption at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new disruption, you can also replace one disruption you know with a different one.</p><h3>Power Dice</h3><p>A power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the disruption.</p><p>Your ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production.  These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of deployed crew members.  Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.</p><h3>Saving Throws</h3><p>Some of your Disruptions require your target to make a saving throw to resist the disruption\u2019s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p><p><strong>Disruption save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your ship\u2019s Charisma modifier</p>"
