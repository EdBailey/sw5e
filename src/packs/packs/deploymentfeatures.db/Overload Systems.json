The ship must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to Interfere checks). On a failed save, the target\u2019s flying speed reduced by half, it\u2019s turning speed is doubled, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, it\u2019s shields no longer regenerate, and it can\u2019t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the ship\u2019s abilities, crew, or equipment, it can\u2019t make more than one attack during its turn.</p><p>The ship\u2019s pilot makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends.</p><p>Once you\u2019ve use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>"
