You can use only one collaboration per turn, and you can only use each collaboration once per round.</p><p>You learn an additional collaboration at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new collaboration, you can also replace one collaboration you know with a different one.</p><h3>Power Dice</h3><p>A power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the collaboration.</p><p>Your ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production.  These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of deployed crew members.  Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.</p>"
