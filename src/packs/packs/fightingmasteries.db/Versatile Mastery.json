While you are wielding a melee weapon with the versatile property with which you are proficient and no other weapons, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>When you are the target of a melee weapon attack, you can immediately use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the target without your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and you impose disadvantage on the triggering roll.</li><li>Once per turn, when you make an attack roll while wielding a weapon in two hands, you can attempt to follow up on the attack. If the attack hits, the creature must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, the creature is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.</li><li>Once per turn, when you make an attack roll while wielding a weapon in one hand, the target is wielding a shield, and your other hand is empty, you can use your other hand to pull down the shield (no action required). If you do so, the creature gains no benefit to armor class from its shield for that attack.</li></ul>"
