If your ranged weapon attacks would already ignore one-quarter and half cover against targets 30 feet or greater from you, they now also ignore three-quarters cover.</li><li>Before you make an attack with a blaster weapon against a target 30 feet or greater from you, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you add twice your proficiency bonus to the attack's damage.</li></ul>"
