            "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Male Besalisks' heads sported prominent crests and four arms hung at their sides; females of the species could have as many as eight arms, but like Humans had a primary hand and a limited range of functionality with the others. The addition of the extra appendages required a hearty metabolism, and these bulky beings were able to store food and water for many days, and if the need arose, they could survive for long periods without either. Scruffy sensory whiskers lined the area below their noses, just above the robust wattle most adult Besalisks possessed.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Because of Ojom's harsh environment, large cities were never developed on the world; instead small communes of about a thousand families claim territories around the world and are each led by an elected leader. The communes have a strict policy of keeping the size of their groupings equal to avoid conflict. When too many families grow in one area, the leader would ask certain families to break away and start a new community on another glacier. While not involved in galactic politics and because they do not produce any of their own technology, the Besalisks established large orbital space stations where offworlders could come to do business. Any violence on these stations is committed by offworlders as Besalisks avoid confrontation and focus on trading and making deals.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Besalisk names are generally words that embody them, with a surname attached to their commune.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Male Names.</strong> Darius, Dexter, Plun, Pong</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Female Names.</strong> Delia, Mora, Ren, Teen</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Surnames.</strong> Jettster, Kil, Krell, Ugg</p>",

The best and worst are found among them.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Besalisks tower over almost all other species, with the smallest standing at 6 feet tall and weighing 200 lbs., and the largest approaching 8 feet tall and 400 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Four-Armed.</strong></em> Besalisks have four arms which they can use independently of one another. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required).</p><p><em><strong>Long-Limbed.</strong></em> When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.</p><p><em><strong>Powerful Build.</strong></em> You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Besalisk.</p>"
