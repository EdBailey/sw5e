            "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2><p>The mon calamari are a bipedal, amphibious species with high-domed heads, webbed hands and large, goggle-like eyes. In addition to being webbed, the mon calamari hand presents three suction-cup like holes on its palm, and featured five claw-tipped fingers: one opposable thumb, two long middle fingers, and two very short outer fingers. Although they are shaped like flippers, their feet can nevertheless fit into boots designed for human-like feet. The females are distinguished from the males by their more prominent chest areas.</p><h2>Society and Culture</h2><p>The mon calamari have developed a very advanced and civilized culture. Their art, music, literature, and science show a creativity surpassed by few in the galaxy. Mon calamari literature depicts stars as islands in a galactic sea, showing a passionate longing to explore space and discover other civilizations. Mon Calamari are both soft-spoken and gentle, slow to anger, and have the remarkable ability to maintain their concentration without being distracted by emotional responses. They are both inquisitive and creative, and have a near-legendary quality of being both determined and dedicated; once a mon calamari decides on a course of action, they are not easily swayed from that decision. They often fixate themselves on \"lost causes.\"</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Mon calamari names generally have a melodic feel.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Male Names.</strong> Creaz, Fior, Hurneerth, Nurrins, Sielpa</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Female Names.</strong> Afwa, Lel, Mhirim, Ri, Theya</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Surnames.</strong> Dualda, Gradi, Tua, Valec, Winab</p>",
