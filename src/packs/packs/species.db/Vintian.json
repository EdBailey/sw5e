            "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Vintians have flinty, flaky surfaces. To some species, vintians resemble rocks or boulders. Despite tending to stand still for long periods of time, Vintians are capable of independent movement. Vintians rest by recrystalyzing.</p>\n<p>Vintians have an incredibly strong grip, which limits their manual dexterity. Additionally, due to their home planet's proximity to its sun, causing perpetual daylight, vintians have a preternatural fear of the dark.</p>\n<p>While vintians have no need for armor, they like to decorate themselves, be it with clothing, paint, or even moss.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Vintians participate in commercial spaceflight operations and some are capable navigators. At least one vintian was known to frequent bars and clubs and was considered to have a \"wild-man\" personality. However vintians can also be quite stoic.</p>\n<p>Despite their appearance, vintians are actually quite malleable, personality-wise. They differ greatly from each other, though most vintians share a great appreciation for humor.</p>\n<p>Vintian society has a rotational governing body. Each vintian is obligated to spend a century serving in public office, beginning no sooner than their hundredth birthday, and they can't leave their home planet until they&rsquo;ve completed their service.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Vintian names vary drastically, though they do not differentiate by gender. Vintians don't use surnames, as they believe they are one family.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; Names.</strong> Anerohl, Bahlbhoa, Geode, Gorge, Dwaagn, Eerohde, Hahrde, Peht, Peeturh, Stixn, Stoahne</p>",
