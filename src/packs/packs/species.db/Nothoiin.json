Nothoiins' appearance has earned their species the nickname of \"Goldskins.\"</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Although nothoiins hail from their eponymous homeworld and star system in the Anoat Sector, they are ubiquitous throughout the Greater Javin Region and Corporate Sectors. Their history of interstellar exploration and colonization was facilitated by their species' natural spacefaring abilities in both piloting and navigation and necessitated by their home planet's periodically harsh, dry climate. Droughts on Nothoiin can last for decades, and the wildfires they foster have served as one of the primary factors behind the limited development of the planet's economy beyond the ur-diamond mining industry, which produces the system's chief export.</p>\n<p>Large-scale emigration from Nothoiin has led members of its native species to seek careers as pilots, navigators, and operatives in numerous criminal enterprises. Various nothoiin colonies have given rise to a number of different governmental systems running the gamut from representative democracies to autocracies.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Nothoiin typically receive a gendered given name and a familial surname.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; Male Names.</strong> Amrosio, Jado, Kosimas, Troov</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; Female Names.</strong> Elayah, Giranti, Lorinah, Sil</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; Surnames.</strong> Caban, Mordu, Plintus, Starstrider</p>",

The best and worst are found among them.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Nothoiins typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh 150 lbs.

You can choose to do this after the check is rolled but before the GM determines if you've passed or failed the check. You cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Major Miners.</em></strong> Nothoiins have intimate knowledge of ur-diamond mining and refinement practices. You gain proficiency in your choice of jeweler's tools or scavenging kit.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Starship Specialists.</em></strong> Whenever you make an Intelligence (Technology) check related to starships, you are considered to have expertise in the Technology skill.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic. You can also communicate via Notho, a native hand language developed by hunters living in the Nothoiin plains. Usage of Notho is exceedingly rare outside Nothoiin culture.</p>"
