Droids are impervious to many effects and vulnerable to others. If your GM approves this choice of species, work with them to determine your droids designation, name, and appearance. If you want to play a different type of droid, work with your GM to find traits to realize your character.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Class IV droids are typically human-like in both shape and size, though there are many advanced models (such as droidekas) that forgo this standardization. They are usually colored to match their affiliation, though personally owned class IV droids might not be. Certain models of class IV droids, such as the HK-series, are made to look like class III droids to disguise their martial nature.</p>\n<h2>Utility</h2>\n<p>Class IV droids are programmed for military and security purposes. Such droids tend to perform tasks of violence or combat might be expected. Almost all class IV droids carry weapons. Armed combat droids are among the first droids ever created. Security, gladiator, battle, and assassin droids are all class IV droids.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Droids are typically called by their designation, given to them when they are created, or some affectation given to them by their owner. Often this affectation is a play on their designation.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, noteworthy droids will earn monikers based on their accomplishments.</p>",

The best and worst are found among them.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Class IV droids typically stand between 5 and 7 feet and weigh about 150 lbs. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Type.</em></strong> Your creature type is droid.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Armor Integration.</em></strong> You cannot wear armor, but you can have the armor professionally integrated into your chassis over the course of a long rest. This work must be done by someone proficient with astrotech&rsquo;s implements. You must be proficient in armor in order to have it integrated.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Droid Resistances.</em></strong> You are resistant to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage, and are immune to poison and disease.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Droid Systems.</em></strong> You do not need to eat or drink. Additionally, you no longer require a tech focus to cast tech powers.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Droid Vulnerabilities.</em></strong> You are vulnerable to ion damage. Additionally, you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal ion or lightning damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Force Insensitive.</em></strong> While droids can be manipulated by many force powers, they can not sense the Force. You can not use force powers or take levels in forcecasting classes.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Maintenance Mode.</em></strong> Rather than sleep, you enter an inactive state to perform routine maintenance for 4 hours each day. You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while performing maintenance.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Martial Protocol.</em></strong> You have proficiency with light and medium armor as well as two simple or martial blasters or vibroweapons of your choice.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Rapid Reconstruction.</em></strong> You are built with internal repair mechanisms. As a bonus action, you can choose to spend one of your Hit Dice to recover hit points.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and one language of your choice. You can understand spoken and written Binary, but you cannot speak it.</p>"
