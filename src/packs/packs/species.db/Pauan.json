            "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2><p>Pau'ans have large, sunken black eyes in red eye sockets and jagged, fang-like teeth used for tearing into raw meat, as they are carnivores. The species has pale, wrinkled skin, due to the fact that they lived in the sinkholes of Utapau, giving them limited access to light. These traits cause some to view them as frightening. However, Pau'ans as a society are generally friendly, and are happy to welcome guests to their often overlooked world. Pau'ans have long lifespans, living up to 700 years, much longer than the Utai. This earned them the nickname of \"Ancients\".</p><h2>Society and Culture</h2><p>Pau'ans fulfill most of the governmental and administrative duties on Utapau, as the utai do not desire such work, serving as laborers instead. Most pau'ans served as leaders early in their lives, often managing teams of Utai laborers. This gives them experience that will be used later in their lives. Pau'ans are kind leaders, and sympathetic to their subordinates. Each city on Utapau is controlled by a Master of Port Administration, a hereditary title reserved for pau'ans. These administrators are assisted by advisory councils for making important decisions about their city, and each administrator serves on the Utapauan Committee and oversees planetary governance. However, the committee rarely makes crucial decisions, as the cities are able to function on their own most of the time.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Pau'an names are fairly simple, and generally melodic. Surnames are familial. </p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Male Names.</strong> Kernul, Sivrol, Tar, Vizun, Yal, Zeolbud</p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Female Names.</strong> Cas, Jevoh, Nesim, Sizil, Ten, Yofan</p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Surnames.</strong> Gesat, Kluneln, Nom, Vley, Voy, Zet",

Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Authoritative.</strong></em> You have proficiency in Persuasion or Intimidation (your choice).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Cultured.</strong></em> You have proficiency in the Lore skill.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You have keen eyesight, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Hypersensitive Hearing.</strong></em> Pau'ans possess incredibly receptive hearing, often to their detriment, so you wear special covers on your ears. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check involving hearing, you are considered to have expertise in the Perception skill, but if your hearing aids are removed, you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal sonic damage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Vigilant.</strong></em> You can choose to have advantage on your next Initiative check. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Utapese. Utapese is characterized by its rigid, yet melodic sound.</p>"
