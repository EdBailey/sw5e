            "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2><p>Felucians are a tall, bipedal species. Both their arms and legs end in four, large webbed digits with suction-cup fingertips. Springing from the underside of each forearm is a second short arm, ending in three large and agile fingers. A Felucian's head is a thick mass of long flexible tendrils featuring illuminated tips. The eyes and mouth appear as black holes or openings within this mass.</p><h2>Society and Culture</h2><p>Felucians are mysterious sentient beings native to the vast fungal swamps and jungles of Felucia. Though Felucia has long been colonized, the native Felucians avoided notice by living deep in the jungle. Such seclusion was easily maintained. Even the hardiest of colonists were loath to brave the perils of the dangerous wilderness without cause.\n\nThe Felucians are an unusual, amphibious species. They are highly adapted to surviving the wilds of their home planet, and fade easily into its confusing mass of plant life. They are equally at home on land or in the water, and they traverse the swamps with ease.\n\nAll Felucians are part of a single, planetwide tribe that is broken down into smaller villages and communities, each one led by shamans and chieftains. These shamans are very strong in the Force, using it to their own ends with incredible skill.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Felucian names are usually two syllables and full of hard consonants. Surnames are a combination of tribe lineage.</p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Male Names.</strong> Gokkuul, Kargrek, Hagark, Ruggorn<p></p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Female Names.</strong> Lakko, Taarell, Duuna, Frula <p></p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Surnames.</strong> s'Gokuul, d'Lakko, s'Kargrek, d'Frula",
