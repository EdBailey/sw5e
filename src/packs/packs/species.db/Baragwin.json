            "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>A hunchbacked species of sentient reptilians, the bipedal baragwin are easily recognized across the galaxy. Noted for their thick, wrinkled skin which can resist most physical attacks and their shuffling gait, the large-headed race have no obvious differences between male and female baragwin. An acute sense of smell gives the species enough sensitivity to detect another being's mood and feelings. This leads some of them into careers as big-game hunters, or even as bounty hunters. Due to their ponderous movement, many non-baragwin believe the race to be a dull-witted people while, in fact, they are quite intelligent. Despite this fact, the baragwin frequently keep this intelligence hidden, using the misconceptions of others to their own advantage.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>Baragwin culture, since it does not derive from a single homeworld, is highly dependent on a baragwin's planet of origin, with Tatooinian baragwin behaving quite differently from those from Denuhi-Eight. Baragwin generally have little prejudice, treating all other beings equally regardless of species, culture, or planetary origins; though criminal baragwin will exploit all beings equally instead. Baragwin settlements are generally small and anarchic, with short-term leaders selected by informal democratic processes. Baragwin are famous as skilled weapon-smiths and have introduced many different weapons to different worlds. Baragwin-made blasters and vibroblades are among the most powerful personal weapons in the galaxy.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Baragwin have names with wide tones, spoken using the entire mouth, that don't differentiate by gender. Baragwin have familial surnames.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;First Names.</strong> Dagel, Eskaul, Idalli, Migo</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Surnames.</strong> Fadani, Igara, Kodrue, Wylbas</p>",

You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine emotions against humanoids and beasts within 10 feet of you.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Travelers.</em></strong> You have proficiency in the Survival skill.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Weapon Developers.</em></strong> Baragwin are famous throughout the galaxy for their quality arms manufacturing. You have proficiency in two vibroweapons or blasters of your choice. Additionally, you have proficiency with armstech's implements or munitions kits.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Galactic Basic and Baragwinian. Baragwinian is a deep language with low rumbling vocalizations. The baragwin themselves, however, were not especially fond of this language. Most of them learned the languages used on whatever planet they were born, so Baragwinian was not very common. Baragwinian was still considered useful as a trade language, however.</p>"
