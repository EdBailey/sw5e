Droids are impervious to many effects and vulnerable to others. If your GM approves this choice of species, work with them to determine your droids designation, name, and appearance. If you want to play a different type of droid, work with your GM to find traits to realize your character.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Class III droids are typically human-like in both shape and size, standing at around 6 feet. They are usually a polished metallic color, though this can vary based on tasks for which they are created, their affiliation, or quirks of their owner.</p>\n<p>They are noteworthy for their slow, shuffling gait and typically overly talkative nature.</p>\n<h2>Utility</h2>\n<p>Class III droids are programmed to interact with humans. They are said to be the most advanced droids ever invented. Protocol, servant, tutor, and child care droids are all class III droids.</p>\n<p>They are usually equipped with protocol chips which give them the cognitive functionality to engage socially.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Droids are typically called by their designation, given to them when they are created, or some affectation given to them by their owner. Often this affectation is a play on their designation.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, noteworthy droids will earn monikers based on their accomplishments.</p>",

The best and worst are found among them.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Class III droids stand around the height of humans and weigh about 150 lbs.

This work must be done by someone proficient with astrotech&rsquo;s implements. You must be proficient in armor in order to have it integrated.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Droid Resistances.</em></strong> You are resistant to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage, and are immune to poison and disease.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Droid Systems.</em></strong> You do not need to eat or drink. Additionally, you no longer require a tech focus to cast tech powers.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Droid Vulnerabilities.</em></strong> You are vulnerable to ion damage. Additionally, you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal ion or lightning damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Force Insensitive.</em></strong> While droids can be manipulated by many force powers, they can not sense the Force. You can not use force powers or take levels in forcecasting classes.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Knowledge Protocol.</em></strong> You have proficiency in the Lore skill.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Maintenance Mode.</em></strong> Rather than sleep, you enter an inactive state to perform routine maintenance for 4 hours each day. You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while performing maintenance.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Rapid Reconstruction.</em></strong> You are built with internal repair mechanisms. As a bonus action, you can choose to spend one of your Hit Dice to recover hit points.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write all registered languages.</p>"
