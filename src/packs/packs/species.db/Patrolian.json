With the advent of multiple wars fought in the system, different armies continuing to see the aquatic world as a strategic bulwark in the region. Because of this, patrolians have to find work not only off-world, but typically in fields not falling under governmental purview. Unfortunately, criminal activities being a common path.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Patrolian names are usually multisyllabic and sing-songy with lots of open vowels and few fricatives. Patrolians are not known to use family names or other surnames.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Male Names.</strong> Dalladu, Feddi, Nogagai, Teconica</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Female Names.</strong> Kakeda, Machibido, Rinimma, Talla</p>",
