            "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Chadra-Fan are covered from head to foot in fur. Their species evolved from small, arboreal rodents. The two different sexes of Chadra-Fan are indistinguishable to other species, though the Chadra-Fan could readily tell the difference using their powerful sense of smell. Chadra-Fan also have involuntary pheromones that conveyed information about their family line and created an aura of attractiveness. Other voluntary pheromones often conveyed a Chadra-Fan's state of emotion-anger, fear, or joy. Chadra-Fan even create more complex messages using their pheromones, though the pheromones when mixed sometimes caused confusion. They are unique in the fact that they had clear blood.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The society of Chadra-Fan is divided into a clan structure in which every member is responsible for parenting the clan's children; a fact of life is that every household is open at any time. Leadership within the clan is a temporary role that is passed from one individual to another as the situation calls for a particular expertise. Children are the centerpiece of a Chadra-Fan community, and only leave when wed. However the new Chadra-Fan couple remain with the smaller clan so it was possible that a Chadra-Fan never leaves his or her home. Chadra-Fan left by themselves suffer depression, so they regularly seek the company of others; thus, Chadra-Fan are not very picky when it came to friends and prefer complete strangers to loneliness.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Chadra-Fan names do not vary significantly based on sex. Surnames are clan based.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>First Names.</strong> Dubi, Kattar, Naska, T'yabah, O'yasha</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Surnames.</strong> Abalomm, Fandy, Nemm, Nuz, Yedit</p>",

You can use these and spend 1 hour and 100 cr worth of materials to construct a Tiny Device (AC 5, 1 hp). You can take the Use an Object action to have your device cause one of the following effects: create a small explosion, create a repeating loud noise for 1 minute, create smoke for 1 minute, emit an onerous smell for 1 minute. You can maintain a number of these devices up to your proficiency bonus at once, and a device stops functioning after 24 hours away from you. You can dismantle the device to reclaim the materials used to create it.</p><p><em><strong>Trance.</strong></em> Chadra-Fan only require 2 hours of sleep a day.
