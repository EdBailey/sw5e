            "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\n<p>Lurmen's bodies are covered entirely in fur, which range in color from a dark brown to a white-gray, though they do wear garments. They can walk either upright on their two legs, and can also use their arms and legs for faster movement Many lurmen have the ability to roll themselves into a wheeled shape; this allows them to cover distances at great speed. They may have learned this ability from the native amani on Maridun.</p>\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\n<p>The lurmen use fallen seedpods from the giant trees as shelter and home. Living near the trees proves too dangerous, as the falling pods can be deadly. Instead, the lurmen drag the pods into a clearing and use them as huts. They also extract essential oils from the pods for nutrition and healing medicines. Most lurmen are pacifistic by nature and refuse to fight or run even in the face of death. They often will hide instead of using violence. As pacifists, they carry no weapons but carry farming tools or ropes. The greatest native threat to the lurmen are the amani and the mastiff phalones, raptor-headed quadrupeds that hunted in groups. However, even in defeating these beasts the lurmen attempt to remain true to their pacifist ideals, and not inflict any injury to the creatures. Instead, when cornered by a mastiff phalone, an agile lurmen will try to unbalance the creature by tying a rope around its stout legs.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Lurmen names are sharp and made up of a single syllable. Instead of surnames, lurmen are granted additional names based on their importance to the village. Common lurmen possess one name, with leaders having as many as four.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Male Names.</strong> Fee, Gatt, Nub, Shoo, Yup</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Female Names.</strong> Kal, Laa, Shal, Vook, Yiit</p>",
