Droids are impervious to many effects and vulnerable to others. If your GM approves this choice of species, work with them to determine your droids designation, name, and appearance. If you want to play a different type of droid, work with your GM to find traits to realize your character.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Appearance</h2>\n<p>Class I droids are typically vaguely human-like in both shape and size, standing at around 6 feet, although some are smaller. They are usually a polished metallic color, though this can vary based on tasks for which they are created, their affiliation, or quirks of their owner.</p>\n<h2>Utility</h2>\n<p>Class I droids are programmed for the mathematical, medical, or physical sciences. Subcategories of the first degree are medical droids, biological science droids, physical science droids, and mathematics droids.</p>\n<p>Medical droids, also known as meddroids, med droids, medical units or surgical droids are a type of droid designed to heal living beings, and are the most commonly found Class I droids.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Droids are typically called by their designation, given to them when they are created, or some affectation given to them by their owner. Often this affectation is a play on their designation.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, noteworthy droids will earn monikers based on their accomplishments.</p>",
