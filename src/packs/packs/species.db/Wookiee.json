            "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2><p>Wookiees are a tall species of furry giants from the planet Kashyyyk, who can grow to a height of over eight feet. They are covered from head to toe in a thick, shaggy coat of hair with water-shedding properties that notably came in shades of brown, black, gray, and white. The species has two sexes, female and male. The latter grows long beards in adult life. Wookiee eye colors are usually blue, green, yellow, golden, brown, or red.</p><h2>Society and Culture</h2><p>Wookiees greatly value honor and loyalty. Therefore, their notion of \"family\" encompassed much more than just blood ties. A part of that most sacred tradition was the social institution of life debt: when a wookiee's life was saved by someone else, regardless of the species, they would frequently devote themselves to a lifetime of service to their savior and their family. Through the mechanism of the life debt, the People of the Trees used to develop unbreakable bonds with their boon companions and true friends, forming an \"honor family.\"</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Wookiee names are diverse; some names are simple and short while others are long and complicated. The majority of names often have softer big sounds and more melodic tones to them. Since offworlders have trouble using wookiees' real names, they often adopt simpler nicknames to go by.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Male Names.</strong> Fubbodrrl, Gurrfupayyc, Kioerrr, Lavgaeffoak, Snrowbishutchuh, Zufiaarkaykkk</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Female Names.</strong> Bulabba, Bonbaegnh, Hopakleupo, Keumnebheu, Onninh, Osstatiemmyock</p>",

Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Claws.</strong></em> Wookiees have retractable claws. You are proficient with your claws, which deal 1d4 kinetic damage on a hit.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>Hide.</strong></em> You have a thick hide. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, your thick hide is naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.</p><p><em><strong>Powerful Build.</strong></em> You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p><p><em><strong>Treeclimber.</strong></em> You have a climbing speed of 30 feet. You have advantage on Strength saving throws and Strength (Athletics) checks that involve climbing.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Shyriiwook. You can understand spoken and written Galactic Basic, but your vocal cords do not allow you to speak it.</p>"
