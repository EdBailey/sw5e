When you cast this power, you can throw two weapons, striking creatures in two lines originating from yourself, both 90 feet long and 5 feet wide, or you can throw one weapon in a 90-foot long, 5-foot wide line of your choice originating from yourself and change its direction to move in a second identical line of your choice within range. Each creature in a line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 damage of the same type as the weapon&rsquo;s damage and 5d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one line is affected only once. The weapons then immediately return to your hand.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Force Potency.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you cast this power using a force slot of 8th level or higher, the weapon damage and force damage each increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 7th.</p>",
