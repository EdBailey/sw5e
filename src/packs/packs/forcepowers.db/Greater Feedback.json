Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can&rsquo;t be affected by this power. A target takes 8d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p>After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a d6 and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. The target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>",
