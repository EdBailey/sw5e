When you use this power, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10. If you reduce the damage to 0 and the damage is energy, force, ion, kinetic, lightning, necrotic, or sonic, you can reflect the attack at a target within range as part of the same reaction. Make a ranged force attack at a target you can see. The attack has a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 90 feet. On a hit, the target takes the triggering attack&rsquo;s normal damage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Force Potency.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage reduction increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.</p>",
