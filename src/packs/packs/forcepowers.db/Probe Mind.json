            "value": "<p>For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the power and as your action on each turn until the power ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p>You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature&mdash;what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it takes 1d6 psychic damage as you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the power ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your forcecasting ability check; if it succeeds, the power ends.</p>\n<p>On subsequent turns after probing deeper, you can use your action to deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target automatically.</p>\n<p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this power is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p>\n<p>You can also use this power to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the power or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The power can penetrate barriers. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.</p>\n<p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.</p>\n<p>This power has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Force Potency.</em></strong> When you cast this power using a force slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial psychic damage a target takes the first time you probe deeper into its mind increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>",
