You can&rsquo;t die from damage or from failed death saving throws while this power is in effect, but the effort taxes you. If you have 0 hit points while you are under the effect of this power, you do not fall unconscious, and continue acting and fighting normally. While you remain at 0 hit points, you must make a death saving throw at the start of each of your turns. Each time you fail a death saving throw, you suffer a cumulative -1 penalty to attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws (including death saving throws). This penalty lasts until you regain hit points. Successful death saving throws have no effect, but a natural 20 restores 1 hit point as usual.</p>\n<p>If you have 0 hit points when this power ends, you die instantly.</p>",
