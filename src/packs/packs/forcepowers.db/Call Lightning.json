The power fails if your location can\u2019t accommodate the cloud\u2019s size or height. When you cast the power, choose a point under the cloud for lightning to strike. Each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity save, taking 3d10 lightning damage on a fail and half on a success. While the power persists, you can use your action to call lightning to a point in range again.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re outdoors and in a storm, the power gives you control of the storm rather than creating a new one. The lightning damage also increases by 1d10.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Force Potency.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you cast this power using a force slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>",
