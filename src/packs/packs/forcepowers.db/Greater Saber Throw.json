On a hit, the target takes 6d8 damage of the same type as the weapon&rsquo;s damage and must make a Constitution saving throw against an additional effect depending on your choice of casting ability:</p>\n<p>Wisdom.&nbsp;The target takes an additional 4d6 force damage and it gains four levels of slowed until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and its speed isn&rsquo;t reduced.</p>\n<p>Charisma.&nbsp;The target takes an additional 4d6 necrotic damage and cannot regain hit points until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and its healing capability is unaffected.</p>\n<p>The weapon then immediately returns to your hand.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Force Potency.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you cast this power using a force slot of 6th level or higher, the force or necrotic damage increases by 1d6 for each slot above 5th.</p>",
