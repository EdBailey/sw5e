When you cast this power, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.</li>\n<li>While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.</li>\n<li>While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. lf it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.</li>\n<li>While the target is cursed, your attacks and powers deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A remove curse power ends this effect. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The GM has final say on such a curse&rsquo;s effect.</p>",
