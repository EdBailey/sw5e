The target must make a Strength saving throw. An object automatically fails this saving throw. On a failed save, the creature or object moves a number of feet in a direction of your choice based on its size. A Tiny creature or object can be moved up to 90 feet, a Small creature or object can be moved up to 60 feet, a Medium creature or object can be moved up to 30 feet, and a Large creature or object can be moved up to 10 feet. If at the end of this movement the creature or object strikes another creature or object, they both take 2d8 force damage.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Force Potency.</strong></em>&nbsp;When you cast this power using a force slot of 3rd level or higher, the range you can throw a creature or object increases by 10 feet, to a maximum of 90 feet, and the power&rsquo;s damage increases by 1d8.</p>",
