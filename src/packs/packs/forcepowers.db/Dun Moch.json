On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your demands. For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this power doesn\u2019t restrict the target\u2019s movement for that turn.</p>\n<p>The power ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a power that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful power on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>",
