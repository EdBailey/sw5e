Each target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be affected by this power for the duration.</p>\n<p>An affected target&rsquo;s speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can&rsquo;t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature&rsquo;s abilities or items, it can&rsquo;t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.</p>\n<p>If the creature attempts to cast a power with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the power doesn&rsquo;t take effect until the creature&rsquo;s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the power. If it can&rsquo;t, the power is wasted.</p>\n<p>A creature affected by this power makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.</p>",
