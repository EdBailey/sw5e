Make a ranged force attack at a target you can see. The attack has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes the triggering attack\u2019s normal damage.</p>\n<p>If you would have resistance to the triggering damage, resistance is applied before the damage reduction.</p>\n<p>The power\u2019s damage reduction increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>",
